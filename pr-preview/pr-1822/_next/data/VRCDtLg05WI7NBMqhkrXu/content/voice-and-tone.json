It’s what conveys the personality of the author. In this case, the author is the [Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/) (DAFF).\n\nThe use of voice and tone affects how users perceive your content. For example, if your content is formal and officious, users will think that the department is formal and officious.\n\nThe goal of content we create for DAFF digital services, is to explain the process of meeting legislation that relates to DAFF. We need to tell our users what they need to do.\n\n<BackToTop />\n\n## Voice\n\nVoice lets users know who content represents, without knowing who the author is. It should be consistent. We should always use the DAFF voice when creating content that represents DAFF.\n\nThe voice that we aim for in the Export Service is:\n\n- clear\n- direct\n- authoritative\n- serious.\n\n<BackToTop />\n\n## Active voice\n\n‘Active voice’ means that the subject performs an action. On the other hand, ‘passive voice’ means that the subject undergoes the action.\n\nWhen you write our content, use [active voice](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/sentences) rather than passive voice. It’s more direct and clearer about what our users need to do to comply with legislation.\n\nThat is, use the general pattern of ‘subject-verb-object’ to convey active voice in content.\n\n<ExampleContent heading={<DoHeading />}>\n\t‘You can apply to register your property as an export establishment.’\n</ExampleContent>\n\n<ExampleContent heading={<DontHeading />}>\n\t‘Your property can be registered as an export establishment.’\n</ExampleContent>\n\n<BackToTop />\n\n## First and second person\n\nFirst and second person convey who is speaking and who is being spoken to within content. It makes content feel more personal to the user.\n\nUse personal pronouns such as ‘you’ and ‘your’ to refer to the user. Use ‘we’, ‘our’ or ‘us’ to represent DAFF.\n\n<BackToTop />\n\n## Tone\n\nThe tone that is represented by DAFF can change and will be different depending on the channel.\n\nAs a general guide, use a tone in the Export Service that is:\n\n- informative\n- [standard formality](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/voice-and-tone)\n- respectful\n- human\n- matter of fact\n- neutral.\n\n<BackToTop />\n\n## Humour\n\nIt can be tempting when writing about rules and legislation to lighten the mood with humour.\n\nBut use humour sparingly - if at all - and carefully. It is subjective and works better in some channels (such as social media), more than others.\n\nAvoid using humour where it might make something less clear.\n\n<ExampleContent heading={<DoHeading />}>\n\"Ask us if you need to lodge an application for a proposed new technology.\n\nWe need to be sure that we understand the risks attached to introducing a new technology or procedure.\"\n\n</ExampleContent>\n\n<ExampleContent heading={<DontHeading />}>\n\"Applicants may propose alternative procedures or new technology, which may or may not be on the grounds of scientific research and differs from currently accepted and approved science and/or industrial practices within the Australian export meat industry, or those detailed in the relevant Australian Meat Standard.\n\nClarification from the department should be sought on the need or not to lodge an application for a proposed new technology or procedure where initial indications are that no adverse impact would result from the introduction of the new technology or procedure.\"\n\n</ExampleContent>\n\n<BackToTop />\n\n## Related links\n\n- [Voice and tone | Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/voice-and-tone)\n- [Writing in plain English](https://mylink-deptagriculture.msappproxy.net/StaffServices/Comms/CreateContent/StyleGuide/Pages/WritinginplainEnglish.aspx)\n- [Content principles](./content-principles)\n- [Content structure](./content-structure)\n- [Content styles](./content-styles)\n- [Content patterns](./content-patterns)\n- [The four dimensions of tone of voice in UX writing ](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/tone-of-voice-dimensions/)\n\n<BackToTop />\n","data":{"title":"Voice and tone","description":"How to say something in the Export Service and how it should sound to our users.","order":3},"title":"Voice and tone","description":"How to say something in the Export Service and how it should sound to our users."},"navLinks":[{"href":"/content/content-principles","label":"Content principles"},{"href":"/content/content-structure","label":"Content structure"},{"href":"/content/voice-and-tone","label":"Voice and tone"},{"href":"/content/content-styles","label":"Content styles"},{"href":"/content/content-patterns","label":"Content patterns"}],"breadcrumbs":[{"href":"/","label":"Home"},{"href":"/content","label":"Content"},{"label":"Voice and tone"}],"toc":[{"id":"introduction","title":"Introduction","level":2,"slug":"introduction","items":[]},{"id":"what-are-voice-and-tone","title":"What are voice and tone?","level":2,"slug":"what-are-voice-and-tone","items":[]},{"id":"voice","title":"Voice","level":2,"slug":"voice","items":[]},{"id":"active-voice","title":"Active voice","level":2,"slug":"active-voice","items":[]},{"id":"first-and-second-person","title":"First and second person","level":2,"slug":"first-and-second-person","items":[]},{"id":"tone","title":"Tone","level":2,"slug":"tone","items":[]},{"id":"humour","title":"Humour","level":2,"slug":"humour","items":[]},{"id":"related-links","title":"Related links","level":2,"slug":"related-links","items":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
