This should occur when the user presses the submit or save and continue button at the bottom of the form page.\n\nThis approach prevents interrupting users while they are still entering information. Real-time validation while the user is still typing can be problematic, especially for users who type slowly.\n\n## Retaining users’ input\n\nIt is important that users do not lose the data they have entered when they attempt to submit the form. Retaining the user’s input allows them to correct any errors without starting over.\n\n## Summarising form validation errors\n\nWhen more than one form validation error has occurred, form validation errors should be summarised as a list inside of a [Page alert](/components/page-alert) component with the `'error'` tone. The [Page alert](/components/page-alert) component should be placed at the top of the form and focused immediately after a submission attempt to ensure it is visible and announced to screen reader users.\n\nTo helps users quickly identify and navigate to the problematic areas of the form, each error in the list should scroll and focus the respective form field when clicked. This can be done with the [useScrollToField](/components/field#usescrolltofield) hook.\n\nIf there is only one form validation error, the [Page alert](/components/page-alert) component and error summary should not be displayed and the invalid form field should be focused immediately after a submission attempt.\n\n## Invalid form fields\n\nForm validation errors should also be displayed as invalid field error messages. Use the same error message in the invalid field and in the error summary, if there is more than one error, so they are consistent and reduce the cognitive effort needed to understand what has happened.\n\nBelow is an example of an invalid form field:\n\n```jsx live\n<TextInput label=\"First name\" required invalid message=\"Enter a first name\" />\n```\n\n## Disabling HTML5 validation\n\nHTML5 validation is a type of client-side validation built into browsers. However, it is not recommended for use with the AgDS due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Inconsistent visual style, placement and content:** HTML5 validation error messages cannot be made customised to be consistent with design system components\n2. **Accessibility concerns:** AgDS components that are used to display form validation errors have been designed to be as accessible and inclusive as possible.\n\nTo disable HTML5 validation, add the `noValidate` attribute to your `form` tags.\n\n```jsx\n<form onSubmit={() => {}} noValidate>\n\t...\n</form>\n```\n\n## Templates\n\nThis pattern has been implemented in the following templates:\n\n- [Single-page form template](/templates/single-page-form)\n- [Multi-page form template](/templates/multi-page-form)\n","data":{"title":"Accessible form validation and error recovery","description":"Form validation is a critical aspect of creating usable and accessible applications.
