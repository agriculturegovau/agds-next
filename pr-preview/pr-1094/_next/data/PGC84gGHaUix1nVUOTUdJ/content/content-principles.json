To find out how we build accessible components, see [Accessibility](/foundations/accessibility).\n\n## Findable\n\nMany users come to content from search engines or site search. That means content needs to be found easily.\n\nEnsure pages have descriptive headings if you create them for the public [Export Service](https://exports.agriculture.gov.au/) site. They should reflect the language of users and describe what is on the page clearly.\n\nThe first heading (H1) at the top of the page should be unique. It’s also an important ranking factor for pages in search engines.\n\n## Consistent\n\nAnother way of reducing cognitive load is to keep content consistent. Try to keep content across the Export Service in the same [Voice and tone]().\n\nUse the same names for common tasks. For example, ‘sign in’ (instead of ‘log in’) to the Export Service.\n\nTo ensure content is consistent, follow our [Content styles](./content-styles) and [Content patterns](./content-patterns). This way users will have a seamless end-to-end journey from one page to another.\n\n## Accurate\n\nContent must be factually accurate. Ensure you research content from credible sources and cross-check multiple sources of truth if you need to.\n\nCheck content with any relevant subject matter experts and make sure they confirm its accuracy.\n\n## Comprehensive\n\nEnsure your content covers everything needed to support the page’s primary aim.
