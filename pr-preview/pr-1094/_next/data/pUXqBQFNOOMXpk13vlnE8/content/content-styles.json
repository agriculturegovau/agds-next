All other words are lower case, except proper nouns.\n\n### Example\n\nFor more information, see Capitalisation in the DAFF Style guide (DAFF staff only).\n\n## Contractions\n\nGrammatical contractions can make things easier to read. That is, using shortened versions of words that combine 2 words, such as ‘don’t’ instead of ‘do not’.\n\nUse simple contractions if it’s appropriate. For example, simple contractions include:\n\n- don’t\n- can’t\n- we’ll\n- we’ve\n- it’s\n- you’ll\n- you’re.\n\nAvoid complex contractions which are harder to interpret. Some users may find these contractions hard to understand. For example, complex contractions include:\n\n- wouldn’t\n- shouldn’t\n- doesn’t\n- cannot\n- haven’t\n- where’ve\n- weren’t.\n\nConduct research where possible to see if you should use contractions in Export Service content.\n\n### Examples\n\n- We’ll get back to you within 2 days.\n\n- You don’t have access to this business.\n\nFor more information, see [Contractions](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/contractions). Also see Abbreviations and other shortened forms in the DAFF Style guide (DAFF staff only).\n\n## Directional language\n\nDirectional language refers to phrases that instruct people where to interact with elements on a web page.\n\nAvoid referring to things using directional language. For example, ‘as shown above’. Try to keep related things as close as possible to each other (ideally in the same sentence).\n\nPeople read content in different ways, making directions like ‘above’, ‘to the right’ and ‘below’ confusing.\n\nUsers of screen readers may jump backwards and forwards through headings and links on a page. Things that appear below something on a mobile screen might be to the right or left on a desktop screen.\n\n## Email addresses\n\nIf you include an email address in Export Service content, the full address should be visible and accessible to users.\n\nDon’t include a full stop after an email address if it’s part of sentence fragment or on a line by itself.\n\nYou can use a full stop after an email address if it’s at the end of a sentence. But make sure the full stop is not included in the link text. Otherwise, users may confuse it with being a part of the email address.\n\n### Examples\n\nFor more information, see [Text link](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/components/text-link) and [Full stops](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/full-stops#dont_end_web_or_email_addresses_with_full_stops).\n\n## Emojis and emoticons\n\nWe don’t use emojis or emoticons in Export Service web content. Some social media channel content use emojis minimally. For example, Twitter and Medium.\n\nIf you write content for a social media channel:\n\n- use emojis minimally (if at all)\n- don’t use emoticons\n- don’t use more than one emoji in a sentence\n- don’t use emojis to replace words\n- don’t use emojis as the only way to express an emotion you intend to communicate\n- use popular emojis that are widely recognised\n- use emojis that translate well across devices\n- use emojis at the end of sentences\n- don’t use emojis that are not visible in both dark and light mode.\n\nFor more information on using humour in content, see [Voice and tone](). For more guidance on emojis, see [Accessibility and inclusion on social media]().\n\n## Error messages\n\nAn error message in the Export Service can be a:\n\n- Page alert, or a\n- message about a form Field.\n\nThere are also 'warning' messages that indicate urgent situations. For example, system alerts. For more information, see Global alert.\n\nWhen you create an error message:\n\n- be specific in describing the error and avoid technical jargon\n- use simpler language and the correct Voice and tone\n- don’t blame the user for the error\n- be specific in describing how and when the error can be fixed\n- include the error code in the message if possible. It may be helpful to a support agent if a user accesses human-led support.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\n- [Error messages]()\n- [Global alert](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/components/global-alert)\n- [Field](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/components/field)\n- [Page alert](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/components/page-alert)\n- [Voice and tone]()\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\nTry not to use a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) to ‘fix’ content that may be hard to understand or follow.\n\nReserve FAQs for ‘edge’ cases as much as possible. That is, user journeys and outcomes that happen rarely. Instead try to make content for all users clearer and more concise.\n\nProvide guidance and answers a user needs in the context of what they are doing. That is, at the point of their journey or within a transaction where they need a piece of information.\n\nIf the information applies to all users, don’t hide an FAQ in an accordion or other component. If it applies to some users only, you can use an [accordion](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/components/accordion).\n\nMonitor and measure the success of FAQs. If no one is using them, remove FAQ content.\n\n## Headings\n\nBreak content up with headings and subheadings. The first heading (H1) should be meaningful and unique to each page. Headings should clearly state what users will find in the content that follows.\n\nIf the page is the unauthenticated space of the [Export Service](https://exports.agriculture.gov.au/help) use keywords. Be consistent with the search intent of your users in search engines.\n\nTry to create headings that are 20 to 70 characters in length. Don’t use colons or full stops in headings.\n\nSearch engines sometimes use H1s instead of title tags in a Search Engine Results Page (SERP). This ensures a H1 is optimised if it’s used for this purpose and will not be cut off on a SERP.\n\nYou can use statement headings. Start with a verb and end with a noun to describe what users want to do in a H1. Avoid starting with ‘how to’ if the statement makes sense without it.\n\nUse conjunctions, prepositions and pronouns in between so a statement heading sounds natural. For example, ‘manage your privacy settings’ or ‘create an account.’\n\nA H1 can also be a question. But try to use questions as headings minimally or instead of a statement. Start with one of the 5 ‘W’s’: ‘who’, ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘when’ or ‘why’ for question headings.\n\nFor more information, see Structuring headings and labels in [Content structure](https://deptagriculture.sharepoint.com/teams/msteams_26787b_671006/Shared%20Documents/3.%20Guidance%20and%20support/Help%20section%20content/linktocome).
