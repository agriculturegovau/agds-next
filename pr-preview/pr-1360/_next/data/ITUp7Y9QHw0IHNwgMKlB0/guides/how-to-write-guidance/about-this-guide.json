It’s important to provide our end users with consistent and [Connected experiences](./types-of-content#connected-experiences) across government services.\n\nPlease note, this guide and the Agriculture Design System's [Content](/content) section is not for use for DAFF staff engaged in regulatory work for agricultural exports.\n\nThese users require knowledge products that support good regulatory outcomes. For example, training packages and instructional materials.\n\nYou can find regulatory guidance in the Export Regulatory Knowledge Hub (internal DAFF staff only). Access the hub on DAFF’s SharePoint intranet site, The source.\n\n<BackToTop />\n\n## User needs\n\nUsers of the Export Service need to feel:\n\n- they are doing the right thing when they complete an Export Service task\n- confident that they understand the legal and regulatory requirements for the transaction, and that they are meeting those requirements.\n\nThe stakes for users can be high. They incur resource costs and face potential loss of market access if they don’t get the processes right.\n\nThis means our guidance and the online user experience must be:\n\n- consistent\n- clear\n- comprehensive\n- accurate\n- accessible.\n\n<BackToTop />\n\n## Updates\n\nThis is a live page. We’ll expand and reiterate versions of it as the Export Service platform grows and changes.\n\nIf you have any questions about this guide or would like to suggest changes, you can contact us.
