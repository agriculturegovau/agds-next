{"pageProps":{"guide":{"slug":"getting-started","content":"\n## What is React?\n\nOur component library is built with React, a popular javascript library for building User Interfaces.\n\nIf you’re new to React we recommend going through official [React getting started documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) and follow along using the [React Hello World CodePen example](http://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/ZpvBNJ?editors=0010).\n\n## If you’re starting a new project…\n\nWe have built a [starter kit](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-starter-kit) in NextJS, Typescript and Emotion which you can clone and use as a starting point for your next project.\n\n### 1. Clone latest code\n\nThese commands clone the latest starter kit code, without the version history or ties to the remote repository.\n\n```sh\ngit clone --depth=1 --branch=main git@github.com:steelthreads/agds-starter-kit.git my-app\nrm -rf ./my-app/.git\n```\n\n### 2. Create new git repository\n\nThe code has been downloaded, but you probably want to set up your own version control. **Rename the project `name` in `package.json`** and then initialise git.\n\n```sh\ngit init\n```\n\n### 3. Install dependencies\n\nNow run the following commands to install packages and run the project.\n\n```sh\nyarn && yarn dev\n```\n\n## If you’re implementing components in an existing project…\n\nAll of our AgDS components can be used in existing React applications. To get everything set up, we need to go through the following steps:\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nOur component library uses the CSS-in-JS styling libraries Emotion and Facepaint which need to be installed as dependencies in your application. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```sh\nyarn add @emotion/react facepaint\n```\n\nYou will also need to configure the emotion babel plugin for the minification and optimization of emotion styles.\n\n```\nyarn add --dev @emotion/babel-plugin\n```\n\nYour `.babelrc` should contain:\n\n```\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"@emotion\"]\n}\n```\n\nIf you're using typescript, your TSConfig `compilerOptions` should contain:\n\n```\n\n\"jsx\": \"react-jsx\",\n\"jsxImportSource\": \"@emotion/react\"\n\n```\n\nFore more information about using emotion with typescript, please refer to the [official documentation](https://emotion.sh/docs/typescript).\n\n### 2. Install AgDS\n\nInstall the `@ag.ds-next/react` package by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```sh\nyarn add @ag.ds-next/react\n```\n\n### 3. Wrap your application in our `Core` component\n\nThe `Core` component needs to wrap your entire application and it is where you can configure the theme and routing/links. For an example of configuring routing/links in AgDS for a Next.js application, please see [the code for our example site](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/tree/main/example-site/components/LinkComponent.tsx).\n\n```tsx\n// This example assumes you are using NextJS\n// This is an example of `_app.tsx`\n\nimport { Core } from '@ag.ds-next/react/core';\nimport { theme } from '@ag.ds-next/react/ag-branding';\n\n// Note: You will need to create this import\nimport { LinkComponent } from './LinkComponent';\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n\treturn (\n\t\t<Core theme={theme} linkComponent={LinkComponent}>\n\t\t\t<Component {...pageProps} />\n\t\t</Core>\n\t);\n}\n```\n\n## That's it\n\nYou can now start using our components!\n\n> We recommend using TypeScript to get the most out of these components. Our example site already uses TypeScript so you can use that as reference. [See code](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/tree/main/example-site).\n\n## What's next?\n\n[Explore our example site](/example-site) to see our list of interface examples, as well as the [related code on GitHub](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/tree/main/example-site).\n\nYou should also explore our wide range of [components](/components), and install the ones you need in your application.\n\nIf you get stuck, feel free to reach out to us in the Design System Teams Chat.\n","source":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    h2: \"h2\",\n    p: \"p\",\n    a: \"a\",\n    h3: \"h3\",\n    pre: \"pre\",\n    code: \"code\",\n    strong: \"strong\",\n    blockquote: \"blockquote\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.h2, {\n      children: \"What is React?\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Our component library is built with React, a popular javascript library for building User Interfaces.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"If you’re new to React we recommend going through official \", _jsx(_components.a, {\n        href: \"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html\",\n        children: \"React getting started documentation\"\n      }), \" and follow along using the \", _jsx(_components.a, {\n        href: \"http://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/ZpvBNJ?editors=0010\",\n        children: \"React Hello World CodePen example\"\n      }), \".\"]\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.h2, {\n      children: \"If you’re starting a new project…\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"We have built a \", _jsx(_components.a, {\n        href: \"https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-starter-kit\",\n        children: \"starter kit\"\n      }), \" in NextJS, Typescript and Emotion which you can clone and use as a starting point for your next project.\"]\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.h3, {\n      children: \"1.
