We do this by applying content ‘patterns’. Patterns help us make sure guidance is clear and consistent.\n\nGuidance is available to the public as well as authenticated users. It helps users:\n\n- understand website context and use\n- understand export requirements relevant to them\n- access and complete authenticated, account-specific transactions.\n\nGuidance is not just text content. Some common examples of guidance are:\n\n- web content, like the unauthenticated space pages in the [Export Service](https://exports.agriculture.gov.au/)\n- user interface (UI) design, like information architecture (IA) and navigation\n- guides and guidelines, like this guide or a step-by-step process\n- forms, like a tailored response to user inputs or a field’s [hint text](/components/field)\n- patterns, like the interactive guidance tool to [Find an export guide for agricultural goods](https://exports.agriculture.gov.au/guides/export-guide-agricultural-goods)\n- templates, like those in [AgDS](/templates)\n- communications, like Austrade's Export Service [News](https://www.austrade.gov.au/news/latest-from-austrade/new-agriculture-export-service-to-make-it-easier-to-get-agri-goods-overseas) page\n- legal content, like disclaimers and consent content.\n\nFor more information, see [Types of content](./types-of-content).\n\nGood guidance should:\n\n- help users to feel confident to self-serve in most situations\n- reduce unnecessary burden on support\n- include triage pathways to support at key moments.\n\nFor more information, see the [Guidance/support feedback loop](#guidancesupport-feedback-loop).\n\n<BackToTop />\n\n## Support\n\nWhen guidance is not enough to allow users to self-serve, they seek support. Support is human-led. Because of this, it’s resource intensive.\n\nOur support channels or mechanisms in the Export Service include:\n\n- feedback buttons, where users can submit instant comments on a page\n- support desk phone and email interactions, including support desk scripts\n- direct contact with business teams.\n\n<BackToTop />\n\n## Guidance/support feedback loop\n\nUsers can self-serve using digital guidance first. If they need more help they can seek human-led support. We aim to:\n\n- reduce the need for human-led support by improving guidance\n- offer fewer, but more effective, pathways from online guidance to support.\n\nBuilding a relationship between guidance and support:\n\n- helps improve our guidance and support\n- reduces Export Service support desk burdens now\n- will continue to reduce the future need for human-led support.\n\n<BackToTop />\n\n## Related links\n\n- [Content](/content)\n- [Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/)\n\n<BackToTop />\n","source":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    h2: \"h2\",\n    p: \"p\",\n    ul: \"ul\",\n    li: \"li\",\n    a: \"a\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components), {BackToTop} = _components;\n  if (!BackToTop) _missingMdxReference(\"BackToTop\", true);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.h2, {\n      children: \"Guidance\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Export Service guidance is content that allows users to self-serve information they need digitally.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"We try to present guidance content in a similar way each time.
