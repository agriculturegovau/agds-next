{"pageProps":{"guide":{"slug":"types-of-content","content":"\n## Export Service content\n\nExport Service content provides online:\n\n- transactions, and\n- information to support the transactions.\n\nWe help users ‘do the thing’ in the [Export Service](https://exports.agriculture.gov.au/) by providing transactions securely in the account authenticated space. For example, to register an establishment.\n\nWe provide information to support most transactions in the [Export Service Help](https://exports.agriculture.gov.au/help) section.\n\nYou can find guidance on how to create content in the Export Service in several places. Get started with the pages in this [How to create guidance in the Export Service guide](/guides/how-to-write-guidance/).\n\nUse it together with the following resources that form our Digital guidance toolkit. They offer more detail on all aspects of creating content that meets users’ needs in the Export Service:\n\n- AgDS [Content](/content) section\n- DAFF Style guide (internal DAFF staff only)\n- [Australian Government Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/).\n\nYou can access the DAFF Style guide on DAFF’s intranet site, The source.

If it’s relevant, consider how to best connect to content in the:\n\n- [Export](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/export) section of the DAFF website\n- [Export Service](https://exports.agriculture.gov.au/) unauthenticated space\n- Export Service account authenticated space.\n\nIf you need to provide context or detail to support Export Service content, try not to duplicate DAFF website content.
