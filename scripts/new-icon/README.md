# new-icon script

This script uses plop.js to generate the files and changes needed to add a new icon to AgDS.

We prefer to use icons from [FeatherIcon](https://feathericons.com) to maintain a consistent style.

Any SVG added to the icon set must meet this criteria:

- Icon must be visually consistent with the rest of the suite
- SVG Must be 24px x 24px
- lines must be based on strokes and not outlined
- SVG must be minified using [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)
