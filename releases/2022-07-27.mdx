description: Rethought our <Columns /> component, improved many of our components to handle colours more consistently, and introduced @babel/runtime as a dependency for most packages.
---

> ⚠️ Note: All releases under the `@ag.ds-next` package scope should be considered alpha pre-releases. Expect breaking changes. Once we are happy with the state of the core packages we will migrate all packages to `@ag.ds`.

In this release, we rethought our `<Columns />` component, improved many of our components to handle colours more consistently, and also introduced @babel/runtime as a dependency for most packages.

## New Packages

```sh
"@ag.ds-next/badge": "1.0.0",
