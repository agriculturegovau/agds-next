box: Add `focusAll` prop to enable a focus ring when the element is programmatically focused.

drawer: Add `elementToFocusOnClose` to allow custom element to be focused when the drawer closes.

page-alert: Add `isHidden` prop to hide alert with CSS so that its `ref` can be passed to the drawer's `elementToFocusOnClose`. Also enable the newly added `focusAll` prop from `Box` to improve accessibility for programmatically focused alerts.
