docs: fix page ordering of related components and patterns in 'table of contents' for components documents.

icon: revert `WarningIcon` to previous version to fix missing path.

section-alert: Add `info` tone. Added `high`, `medium` and `low` variants to all tones. Increase border left width from `xl` to `xxl`. Legacy tones `success`, `error` and `warning` will now render to `successHigh`, `errorHigh` and `warningHigh` respectively.
