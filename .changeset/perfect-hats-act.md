Date picker

- Added new prop `hideDateFormatLabel` which stops the date format from being appended to the label. When this is disabled, you must provide the date format via the hint text.

Date range picker

- Added new prop `hideDateFormatLabel` which stops the date format from being appended to the label. When this is disabled, you must provide the date format via the hint text.

Field

- Updated behaviour of the `secondaryLabel` prop to append so it will always append the secondary label, instead of replacing the "(optional)" text.
