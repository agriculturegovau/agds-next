# Agriculture Design System (AgDS)

AgDS provides a framework and a set of tools to help designers and developers build the steel threads of the Export Service quickly, efficiently and consistently.

AgDS is based on the [GOLD Design System](https://gold.designsystemau.org/) which incorporates the highest usability and accessibility standards, helping us to deliver a consistent experience for all users, in line with the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/about-digital-service-standard).

The system is in early development right now. Feel free to look around and leave feedback or suggestions if you like but please do not depend on these components just yet. We're working hard to get a stable release out as soon as we can.
