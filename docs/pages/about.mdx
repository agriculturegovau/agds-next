# About AgDS

Agriculture Design System (AgDS) is a suite of guidelines and tools for designers and developers who build the interactive experiences of the Export Service. AgDS enables consistent, intuitive and accessible applications with efficiency and scale - while also promoting collaboration between product teams.

The Agriculture Design System is the best way to ensure we meet our legal obligations to ensure accessibility. Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, Australian Government agencies are required to ensure information and services are provided in a non-discriminatory accessible manner. That is why AgDS provides a suite of components, templates and guides to ensure Export Service applications are designed with accessibility built-in.

export default ({ children }) => (
	<MarkdownPageTemplate>{children}</MarkdownPageTemplate>
);

AgDS is based on the GOLD Design System which incorporates the highest usability and accessibility standards, helping us to deliver a consistent experience for all users, in line with the Digital Service Standard.
