title: About AgDS
description: The Agriculture Design System (AgDS) is the Design System built for the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF).
---

It is a suite of guidelines and tools for designers and developers who build interactive experiences on the web. It enables consistent, intuitive and accessible applications with efficiency and scale - while also promoting collaboration between product teams.

Its primary purpose is for building the Export Service, however is also in use in other areas of the Department.

The toolkit includes:

- [A React component library](/components)
- [A library of Figma components](/guides/figma)
- A suite of [page templates](/templates) and [interaction patterns](/patterns)
- Comprehensive documentation
- A collaborative community of designers and developers

## Accessibility from the ground up

AgDS is based on the [GOLD Design System](https://gold.designsystemau.org) which incorporates the highest usability and accessibility standards, helping us to deliver a consistent experience for all users, in line with the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/about-digital-service-standard).

The Agriculture Design System is the best way to ensure we meet our legal obligations to ensure accessibility. Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, Australian Government agencies are required to ensure information and services are provided in a non-discriminatory accessible manner. That is why AgDS&apos;s suite of components, templates and guides are designed with the highest accessibility standards.
