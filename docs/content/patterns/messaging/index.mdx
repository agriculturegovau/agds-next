## Global alert

[Global alerts](/components/global-alert) display prominent service or system wide messages at the top of the screen.

They are used to communicate system or service wide messages, not page or feature messages. Global alerts are not initiated by the user and should persist for a session but can be dismissed by the user.

```jsx live
<GlobalAlert title="Alert title">
	<Text as="p">
		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Fusce massa nibh,
		aliquam vel dolor non, gravida porttitor nulla. Pellentesque cursus orci
		vulputate nibh sagittis blandit.
	</Text>
</GlobalAlert>
```

## Page alert

[Page alerts](/components/page-alert) are colour-coded, non-disruptive notifications that provide Success, Error, Warning or Information messages at relevant times during the user journey.

Typically page alerts appear in the top of a page following a submit action.

```jsx live
<PageAlert tone="error" title="There is a problem">
	<Text as="p">Please correct the following fields and try again</Text>
	<UnorderedList>
		<ListItem>
			<TextLink href="#">Full name must not be empty</TextLink>
		</ListItem>
		<ListItem>
			<TextLink href="#">Email must not be empty</TextLink>
		</ListItem>
	</UnorderedList>
</PageAlert>
```

## Section alert

[Section alerts](/components/section-alert) are colour-coded, non-disruptive notifications that provide Success, Error, Warning or Information messages that are delivered in context at a specific section of the screen.

Section alerts appear above an interactive component or at the top of a page section, and provide information or status following an action.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="Your changes have been saved" tone="success" />
```

## Invalid field

Alert the user of something that has happened in an input component. They appear above the input and after any label or hint text.

A border is added to the left-margin of the input to group the message to the component.

```jsx live
<Field
	label="Email"
	invalid
	message="Enter an email address in the correct format, like name@example.com"
>
	{(a11yProps) => <input type="email" {...a11yProps} />}
</Field>
```

## Callout

[Callouts](/components/callout) are used draw attention to persistent, important or interesting information and should not be used to communicate validation or status.

An information hierarchy can be created with Callouts by applying the Feature, Information and Neutral variants of the component. The Feature variant of Callout has a larger icon and heading to draw a users attention.

```jsx live
<Callout title="Callout heading">
	<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
</Callout>
```
