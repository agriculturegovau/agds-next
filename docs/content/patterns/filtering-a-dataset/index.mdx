Filters can help a user find something they're looking for and see available options within a certain criteria.

When filters are applied, tags are added below the filters so that users can see the changes that are being applied to the dataset. Users can remove tags individually or for all filters

<DoHeading />

- use primary filters for most commonly used
- prioritise filters by expected usage

<DontHeading />

- remove tags feature as they allow users to see the selections that are active and remove them easily
- use long radio/checkbox groups

## Filter input methods

Filters need to work within a limited space, so consider using input methods that do not need much space, such as:

- [Text input](/components/text-input)
- [Select](/components/select)
- [Control input (checkbox and radio)](/components/control-input)
- [Combobox](/components/combobox)
- [Search input](/component/search-input)
- [Switch](/components/switch)
- [Date picker](/components/date-picker)

## Filter sizes

Filters patterns are available in 3 sizes to accommodate a wide range of use cases and data sets:

- **Small:** 1-2 filters
- **Medium:** 3-6 filters
- **Large:** 6+ filters (coming soon)

## Small filter pattern

Small is intended for 1-2 filters that sit above the dataset.

## Medium filter pattern

Medium is intended to display 3-6 filters in an accordion that are opened and closed by a button.

1 to 2 of the most used filters should be displayed as the primary filters outside the accordion to make them easier and faster to access.

Tags are added below the filters to show which are active and give the user an easy way to clear them.
