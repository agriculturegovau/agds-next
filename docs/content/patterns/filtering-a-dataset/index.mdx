Filters can help a user find something they're looking for and see available options within a certain criteria.

Primary filters give users the fastest way to find what they're looking for.

When filters are applied, tags are added below the filters so that users can see the changes that are being applied to the dataset. Users can remove tags individually or for all filters.

<DoHeading />

- choose the right filter pattern to meet user needs
- prioritise filters by expected usage
- include 1-2 primary filters above the dataset

<DontHeading />

- remove tags feature as tags allow users to see the selections that are active and remove them easily

## Filter input methods

Filters need to work within a limited space, so consider using input methods that do not need much space, such as:

- [Search input](/component/search-input)
- [Text input](/components/text-input)
- [Select](/components/select)
- [Checkbox](/components/checkbox)
- [Radio](/components/radio)
- [Combobox](/components/combobox)
- [Switch](/components/switch)
- [Date picker](/components/date-picker)
- [Date range picker](/components/date-picker)

## Filter patterns

Filter patterns are available in 3 sizes to accommodate a wide range of use cases and data sets:

- **Small:** 1-2 filters
- **Medium:** 3-6 filters
- **Large:** 6+ filters

## Small filter pattern

Small is intended for 1-2 filters that are visible and sit above the dataset.

The small pattern is typically comprised of primary filters.

## Medium filter pattern

Medium is intended to display 3-6 filters in an accordion that is opened and closed by a button.

1 to 2 of the most used filters should be displayed as the primary filters outside the accordion to make them easier and faster to access.

Tags are added below the filters to show which are active and give the user an easy way to clear them.

## Large filter pattern

Large is intended to display 6+ filters in a [Filter drawer](/components/filter-drawer).

1 to 2 of the most used filters should be displayed as the primary filters outside the Filter drawer to make them easier and faster to access.

Related filters should be grouped together in a [Fieldset](/components/fieldset).

Tags are added below the primary filters to show which are active and give the user an easy way to clear them.
