## Small list

A simple list of [Checkboxes](/components/checkbox) should always be preferred. This is the most accessible solution as it provides users with a clear understanding of all the available options. It also eliminates the need for additional interactions such as opening a dropdown menu.

```jsx live
<ControlGroup label="Example" block>
	<Checkbox value="a">Option A</Checkbox>
	<Checkbox value="b">Option B</Checkbox>
	<Checkbox value="c">Option C</Checkbox>
</ControlGroup>
```

## Large list

The [ComboboxMulti](/components/combobox) component can be used when there are a large number of options or vertical space is limited. It allows users to search and select options from a dropdown menu. However, this approach requires additional interaction and may not be as clear as a simple list of checkboxes.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState([]);
	return (
		<ComboboxMulti
			label="Select country"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
			options={COUNTRY_OPTIONS}
		/>
	);
};
```
