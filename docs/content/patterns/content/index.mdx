## Usage guidelines

- Don't split content into multiple columns. Text and other content should be stacked in the right column.
- Don't use the left column for content. It's reserved for optional side navigation.
- Add an [Inpage nav navigation component](/components/inpage-nav) to longer pages. If your page has more than 2 second-level headings, consider adding in-page navigation. This will help users find what they need quickly.
- Don't overuse the [Callout component](/components/callout) or use them to display important information that isn't included elsewhere on the page. Users can mistake them for ads or banners and may ignore them.
- Keep important content at the top of the page.
- Use clear descriptive headings.
