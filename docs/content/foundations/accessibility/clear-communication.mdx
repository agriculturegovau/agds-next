## Communication in AgDS

We provide examples throughout the design system components and documentation to get you started on clear communication in your digital products and services.

Our use of clear communication in elements like headings, titles, labels and content order throughout our design system achieved full WCAG conformance in accessibility audits in 2022 and 2024. Implementation of AgDS clear communication is demonstrated in the [yourGov](/yourgov) application.

## Requirements

### Button

- Use clear, concise button labels that describe the action. We recommend using verb and noun pairs – for example: ‘Save changes’, ‘Submit application’, ‘Delete record’.
- Button labels are unique when multiple buttons appear on the same page.
- When icons are used alone, ensure the button’s accessible name is a clear, sensible interpretation of that icon’s action.

### Instructions

- Any required format, constraints or instructions for inputs are clearly communicated.
- Hint text is provided when it’s helpful – for example, when requesting a specific format.

### Labels

- Labels clearly identify the purpose of form controls and inputs.
- The purpose of a form control or input is understood and conveyed by assistive technology.

### Links

- Links have clear, concise and descriptive text.
- Link text is unique and avoids generic phrases like ‘Click here’ or ‘Learn more’.
- If a link opens in a new window, tab or drawer, indicate this visually to the user.
- Links have an accessible name that indicates if they open in a new window, new tab or drawer.

### Page titles and headings

- Page titles clearly describe the topic or purpose of the page.
- Headings clearly describe or introduce content.
- Headings are identified using `h1` to `h6`.
- Headings follow the order and importance within the other headings on the page.
- Visual order of content follows the logical reading order.

### Text alternatives

- Text alternatives are provided for any informative non-text content.
- Non-text content that does not help a user understand page content is marked as decorative.

## Benefits

- Users can understand if a web page is relevant to their needs.
- Information is easier to locate.
- Creates a logical structure for screen reader navigation.
- Content makes sense regardless of the technology used.
- Users of assistive technology are presented with the same information as other users.
- Helps users understand the organisation and relationship of content.
- Increases understanding of the content that comes next.
- All users can identify the purpose of links.
- Screen reader users can understand the purpose of each link before activating it.
- Supports users by providing clear expectations.
- Improves usability and reduces confusion over where links will lead.
