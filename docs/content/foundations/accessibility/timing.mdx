Timing in AgDS
We recommend WCAG conformant timing to ensure your digital products and services are stress free are accessible for a wide audience. We don’t support time-based alerts like ‘Toasts’ and prefer persistent patterns like section alerts to inform users about changes.

Requirements 
For any time limit, such as a session time out, at least one of the following is true:
•	Users can turn the time limit off before the limit is reached.
•	Users can extend the time limit to at least 10 times the default setting before the time limit is reached.
•	Users receive a warning before time expires, with at least 20 seconds to extend.

Benefits
•	Accommodates a range of users who need more time to read content or complete tasks, including those with low dexterity, cognitive disabilities and low vision.
•	Reduces pressure for all users.
•	Prevents loss of data due to unexpected time outs.
