## Motion and animation in AgDS

We use animation to help users identify and understand the micro interactions of the user interface. We also avoid animation and movement that could distract users.

We have applied WCAG motion and animation criteria to components in the design system and the [yourGov](/yourgov) app – for example when designing the Drawer component. You can also use these to ensure an accessible and smooth user experience in your digital products and services.

Motion and animation in our components and patterns achieved full WCAG conformance in accessibility audits in 2022 and 2024.

## Requirements

- Animation doesn’t take longer than 5 seconds.
- Animation doesn’t flash more than 3 times per second.
- Users must be able to pause, stop or hide any automatically updating content in the drawer.

## Benefits

- Prevents seizures and physical discomfort for photosensitive users.
- Prevents dizziness and other physical discomfort for users with vestibular disorders.
- Reduces distractions for users with attention disorders.
- Accommodates users with cognitive disabilities who have difficulty interacting with moving content.
