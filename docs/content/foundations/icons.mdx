## Usage guidelines

When using an icon, always provide a label and accessible name. Don't use icons without labels because you will confuse some users - even the simplest icons will be new or uncommon to some users

Each icon in our library is meaningful and universal, to ensure users understand them. Icons should not be too detailed, to ensure it's clear at all sizes.

## React component

The [Icon component](/components/icon) is used to apply our set of universal icons to more complex components of the system.

## All icons
