---

## Updates

### [App layout](/components/app-layout)

- Removed `overflow: hidden` from `AppLayoutContent` to support sticky elements. Added `min-width: 0` to fix large tables breaking layout on smaller devices.

### [Autocomplete](/components/autocomplete)

- Added search icon.

### [Box](/components/box)

- Add support for more colours in background, foreground and border props.

### [Callout](/components/callout)

- Added info tone and compact variant
- Added support for custom icons.

### [Control group](/components/control-group)

- Added flex wrapping so horizontal options can break into multiple lines if required.

### [Core](/components/core)

- Added `xxl` breakpoint token
- Added `none` border-width.

### [Details](/components/details)

- Added new prop `onBodyAlt`. If the Details component is placed on a page with bodyAlt background, set the `onBodyAlt` prop to true
- Updated width of interactive element to match content.

### [Drawer](/components/drawer)

`Filter drawer` has been renamed to `Drawer`.

The `FilterDrawer` component will continue to work out of the the `@ag.ds-next/react/filter-drawer` entrypoint, but this usage has been marked as deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.

To upgrade, update the import and component name when using these components.

```diff
- import { FilterDrawer } from '@ag.ds-next/react/filter-drawer';
+ import { Drawer } from '@ag.ds-next/react/drawer';
```

### [Dropdown menu](/components/dropdown-menu)

- Added new prop `offset`
- Updated padding of label element in `DropdownMenuGroup`
- Swapped from display style to conditional rendering to improve panel element anchoring
- Improve handling of menu items with long labels.

### [Filter sidebar](/components/filter-sidebar)

- Created new component for filtering layouts.

### [Search input](/components/search-input)

- Updated search icon position.

### [SectionAlert](/components/section-alert)

- Created new component.

### [Switch](/components/switch)

- Updated width of interactive element to match content.
