The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Export Services Design System Team is proud to announce the beta release the Agriculture Design System (AgDS).

AgDS provides a framework and a set of tools to help designers and developers build the steel threads of the Export Service quickly, efficiently and consistently. It includes a library of components available for both React and Figma, a suite of templates and examples, as well as documentation and guidelines for how to best use the available tools.

The AgDS team have been working hard for over a year to get AgDS to where it is today and have received great feedback so far from our product teams. The move from Alpha to Beta demonstrates our confidence in the foundations of AgDS, not just for the components, but also in the core design language, component architecture, accessibility, and Figma library.

AgDS is based on the former Australian Government Design System GOLD which incorporates the highest usability and accessibility standards, helping us to deliver a consistent experience for all users, in line with the Digital Service Standard. We’ve taken the aesthetic and many design principles of GOLD and extended it to meet the needs of the Export Service with a modern React and Typescript architecture.

Accessibility is a huge focus area for AgDS and we have recently undertaken an extensive accessibility audit and usability research sessions by independent third party specialists Intopia. We are proud to say we achieved AA-level compliance against the WCAG v2.1 standard from Intopia who now refer to it as an exemplary implementation of an accessible React based Design System.

## Whats new in Beta?

For designers, the AgDS Figma file has been refreshed and now includes a component gallery so you can easily copy common component variants into your designs, and reference general guidance for the components.

For developers, we’ve moved our React component library from multiple packages into a single package. This is a huge quality of life improvement for developers, by simplifying their dependency management.

And finally, we’ve made multiple improvements and enhancements to our website including a redesigned Components section and new Tokens section. We have also migrated our documentation website from Github to design-system.agriculture.gov.au.

The AgDS team is led by Adrian Yee and consists of designers Adham Dannaway and Paul Maher, as well as engineers Jordan Overbye and Nathan Simpson from Thinkmill.

## Upgrade guide

Current users of AgDS will need to follow this two step guide in order to upgrade from our previous multi-package distribution method.

### Step 1: Update package.json

In your `package.json` file, remove all current dependencies to `@ag.ds-next/*` (e.g. `@ag.ds-next/box`) and replace with a single dependency `@ag.ds-next/react` at version `1.0.0`.

Once you have done that, you will need install your dependencies (e.g. run `yarn` or `npm install`).

### Step 2: Update imports

All imports to `@ag.ds-next/*` will also need to be updated. Using a code editors find and replace with RegEx feature makes this a fairly straightforward task.

```
Find:    '@ag.ds-next/(.*)'
Replace: '@ag.ds-next/react/$1'
```

This will results in changes that look similar to the following:

```diff
- import { Box, Flex, Stack } from '@ag.ds-next/box';
+ import { Box, Flex, Stack } from '@ag.ds-next/react/box';
```

## Released packages

```sh
"@ag.ds-next/react": "1.0.0"
```
