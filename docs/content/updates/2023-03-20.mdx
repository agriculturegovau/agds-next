- Updated the `palette` prop to accept responsive values. For example `<Box palette={["dark", "light"]} />`. ([PR #1021](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/pull/1021))

### [Combobox](/components/combobox)

- Fixed bug where the dropdown trigger button and clear button were not being marked or shown as disabled ([PR #981](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/pull/981))

### [Date picker](/components/date-picker#date-picker)

- Updated default label to show "(optional)" when the field is not required. This is consistent with all other form components in the design system. ([PR #1008](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/pull/1008))
- Added new prop `onInputChange` which can be used to track the value of the text input ([PR #997](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/pull/997))
- Updated the type of the `value` prop so it can accept string (which represents the value of the text input) ([PR #997](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/pull/997))
- Removed unused prop `placeholder` ([PR #1016](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/pull/1016))
- Removed options `xs` and `sm` from `maxWidth` prop. These widths were too small to be used in this component. ([PR #1016](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/pull/1016))
- Improved styles for disabled state ([PR #981](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/pull/981))

- Added support for a legend to be supplied via a new `legend` prop. If no legend is supplied, a default legend of `Date range` will be rendered but will be visually hidden. ([PR #1000](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/pull/1000))
- Added support for hint text via the `hint` prop ([PR #1000](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/pull/1000))

- Improved test coverage ([PR #999](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/pull/999))

### [Field](/components/field)

- Updated behaviour of the `secondaryLabel` prop so it will prepend any text to the label instead of replacing default secondary label "(optional)". ([PR #1008](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/pull/1008))
