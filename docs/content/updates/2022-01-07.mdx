Changes to improve usability of primitive components and to better enable using framework provided link components.

- `Body`: Applied fontGrid to some content elements
- `Core`, `LinkList`, `MainNav`: Add a linkComponent to Core which can be used in LinkList and MainNav. This enables supporting Link components from `next.js` or `react-router` inside DS components.
- `Box`: Added `flexGrow` and `flexShrink` props

> ⚠️ Note: All releases under the `@ag.ds-next` package scope should be considered alpha pre-releases. Expect breaking changes. Once we are happy with the state of the core packages we will migrate all packages to `@ag.ds`.
