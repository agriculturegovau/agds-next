### [Badge](/components/badge)

[Indicator dot](/components/indicator-dot), [Notification badge](/components/notification-badge) and [Status badge](/components/status-badge) have been moved to their own entry points.

These components will continue to work out of the the `@ag.ds-next/react/badge` entrypoint, but this usage has been marked as deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.

To upgrade, update the import when using these components.

```diff
- import { IndicatorDot, NotificationBadge, StatusBadge } from '@ag.ds-next/react/badge';
+ import { IndicatorDot } from '@ag.ds-next/react/indicator-dot';

+ import { StatusBadge } from '@ag.ds-next/react/status-badge';
```
