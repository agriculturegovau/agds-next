title: AgDS Beta v1.1.0 release
description: New FileInput component and new icons. Bug fixes and improvements.
---

## New components

### [File input](/components/file-input)

A simple input for selecting files in a form. The `FileInput` component is a wrapper around the native `<input type="file" />` element. Use when you require multiple files in a form, which must be associated as seperate fields. If you only require a single file, use the [FileUpload](/components/file-upload) component instead.

```jsx live
<FileInput label="Drivers license" />
```

## Updates

### [Card](/components/card)

- Prevent link event from firing twice

### [Combobox](/components/combobox)

- Fixed bug in `ComboboxAsync` where options would be loaded on initial render incorrectly.
- Fixed a bug where the input element became non-interactive after blur

### [Icon](/components/icon)

- Added new icons: `ChartBarIcon`, `ChartLineIcon`, `DeleteIcon`, `DownloadIcon`, `EditIcon`, `FilterIcon`, `HelpIcon` and `PrintIcon`

### [Tags](/components/tags)

- Add support for removing tags

### [Text input](/components/text-input)

- Apply body background to all inputs

## Released packages
