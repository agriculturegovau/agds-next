---

## Updates

### [App layout](/components/app-layout)

- Fixed small issue in `AppLayoutSidebar` where the text color wasn't being applied correctly to text list items in dark mode
- Extended the `items` prop in `AppLayoutSidebar` to accept an object with `options` and `items`. This allows consumers to control the padding between sidebar navigation groups.

### [File upload](/components/file-upload)

- Added thumbnails to selected files. This can be disabled via a new `hideThumbnails` prop
- Extended the `accept` prop so MIME types that are not in the predefined list can be used
- Exported `formatFileSize` utility function. Example usage: `import { formatFileSize } from '@ag.ds-next/react/file-upload'`
- Upgraded internal `react-dropzone` dependency

### [Icon](/components/icon)

- Created new icon `FileIcon`

### [table](/components/table)

- Created new components for batch table actions: `TableBatchActionsBar` and `TableBatchActionsTitle`

- Created new `TableRow` component. If you're using the standard `<tr>` HTML element, you can optionally upgrade to this new component.

<Table>
