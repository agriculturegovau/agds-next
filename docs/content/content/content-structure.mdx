## Use the right page template

Start creating content in the Export Service by using the right page template. To select the type of page and source the code, see [Templates](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/templates).

For example, you can create a landing or static web page using a [Content page template](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/templates/content).

## Keep important content at the top

Order your page content from most important content at the top, where users will find it quickly.

If you want to provide more detail or background, place this lower on the page.

Users may choose to continue down the page for more detail but should not need to do so to find the main point.

## Keep important terms to the left

Most users will scan the left of the page quickly to find what they’re looking for. Keep important terms to the left so they can recognise relevant content quickly.

## Keep pages short

Long pages can be ineffective. If your page is becoming longer than a couple of scrolls, consider its purpose.

Does it offer more than one task, or try to serve multiple needs? If so, try to break the page up so each page serves only one main purpose.

This makes it quicker and easier for users to understand if the page is relevant to what they need.

## Use paragraphs and lists

Good organisation of content on a page makes it easier for users to skim-read.

Break content up with subheadings and short paragraphs. Also use bulleted and numbered lists where appropriate.

Use a bulleted list when there’s more than one item of a similar type. Use a numbered list for step-by-step instructions. For more information, see [Lists](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists).

## Structuring headings and labels

Use meaningful headings and labels so they are more accessible to all users.

Headings should clearly state what the user will find on the page or paragraph that follows.

Headings should be:

- short as usefully possible
- clear
- descriptive
- unique.

Be specific on button labels. They should describe the action that happens next if the user selects it. Try to use the same language on a link as the heading of the page it links to.

Avoid using general language that does not provide the full context. For example, ‘read more’.

## Use the users’ language

Find out how users refer to a thing and use that language in your content.

It does not matter to the user what we call a process or an item; if they have a well-known term for something, use that term and not ours.
