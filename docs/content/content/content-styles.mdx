## Ampersands

Don’t use the ampersand symbol (&) instead of ‘and’ in a heading or sentence in the Export Service.

That’s unless it’s a part of a proper noun or name.

### Example

## Capitalisation

We use capitalisation minimally in the Export Service and sentence case generally.

That is, use a capital on the first word only in a header or sentence. All other words are lower case, except proper nouns.

### Example

For more information, see Capitalisation in the DAFF Style guide (DAFF staff only).

## Contractions

Grammatical contractions can make things easier to read. That is, using shortened versions of words that combine 2 words, such as ‘don’t’ instead of ‘do not’.

Use simple contractions if it’s appropriate. For example, simple contractions include:

- don’t
- can’t
- we’ll
- we’ve
- it’s
- you’ll
- you’re.

Avoid complex contractions which are harder to interpret. Some users may find these contractions hard to understand. For example, complex contractions include:

- wouldn’t
- shouldn’t
- doesn’t
- cannot
- haven’t
- where’ve
- weren’t.

Conduct research where possible to see if you should use contractions in Export Service content.

## Directional language

Directional language refers to phrases that instruct people where to interact with elements on a web page.

Avoid referring to things using directional language. For example, ‘as shown above’. Try to keep related things as close as possible to each other (ideally in the same sentence).

People read content in different ways, making directions like ‘above’, ‘to the right’ and ‘below’ confusing.

Users of screen readers may jump backwards and forwards through headings and links on a page. Things that appear below something on a mobile screen might be to the right or left on a desktop screen.

## Email addresses

If you include an email address in Export Service content, the full address should be visible and accessible to users.

Don’t include a full stop after an email address if it’s part of sentence fragment or on a line by itself.

You can use a full stop after an email address if it’s at the end of a sentence. But make sure the full stop is not included in the link text. Otherwise, users may confuse it with being a part of the email address.

### Examples

For more information, see [Text link](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/components/text-link) and [Full stops](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/full-stops#dont_end_web_or_email_addresses_with_full_stops).

## Emojis and emoticons

We don’t use emojis or emoticons in Export Service web content. Some social media channel content use emojis minimally. For example, Twitter and Medium.

If you write content for a social media channel:

- use emojis minimally (if at all)
- don’t use emoticons
- don’t use more than one emoji in a sentence
- don’t use emojis to replace words
- don’t use emojis as the only way to express an emotion you intend to communicate
- use popular emojis that are widely recognised
- use emojis that translate well across devices
- use emojis at the end of sentences
- don’t use emojis that are not visible in both dark and light mode.

For more information on using humour in content, see [Voice and tone](). For more guidance on emojis, see [Accessibility and inclusion on social media]().

## Error messages

An error message in the Export Service can be a:

- Page alert, or a
- message about a form Field.

There are also 'warning' messages that indicate urgent situations. For example, system alerts. For more information, see Global alert.

When you create an error message:

- be specific in describing the error and avoid technical jargon
- use simpler language and the correct Voice and tone
- don’t blame the user for the error
- be specific in describing how and when the error can be fixed
- include the error code in the message if possible. It may be helpful to a support agent if a user accesses human-led support.

For more information, see:

- [Field](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/components/field)
- [Page alert](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/components/page-alert)
- [Voice and tone]()

## Frequently asked questions

Try not to use a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) to ‘fix’ content that may be hard to understand or follow.

Reserve FAQs for ‘edge’ cases as much as possible. That is, user journeys and outcomes that happen rarely. Instead try to make content for all users clearer and more concise.

Provide guidance and answers a user needs in the context of what they are doing. That is, at the point of their journey or within a transaction where they need a piece of information.

If the information applies to all users, don’t hide an FAQ in an accordion or other component. If it applies to some users only, you can use an [accordion](https://design-system.agriculture.gov.au/components/accordion).

Monitor and measure the success of FAQs. If no one is using them, remove FAQ content.

## Headings

Break content up with headings and subheadings. The first heading (H1) should be meaningful and unique to each page. Headings should clearly state what users will find in the content that follows.

If the page is the unauthenticated space of the [Export Service](https://exports.agriculture.gov.au/help) use keywords. Be consistent with the search intent of your users in search engines.

Try to create headings that are 20 to 70 characters in length. Don’t use colons or full stops in headings.

Search engines sometimes use H1s instead of title tags in a Search Engine Results Page (SERP). This ensures a H1 is optimised if it’s used for this purpose and will not be cut off on a SERP.

You can use statement headings. Start with a verb and end with a noun to describe what users want to do in a H1. Avoid starting with ‘how to’ if the statement makes sense without it.

Use conjunctions, prepositions and pronouns in between so a statement heading sounds natural. For example, ‘manage your privacy settings’ or ‘create an account.’

A H1 can also be a question. But try to use questions as headings minimally or instead of a statement. Start with one of the 5 ‘W’s’: ‘who’, ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘when’ or ‘why’ for question headings.
