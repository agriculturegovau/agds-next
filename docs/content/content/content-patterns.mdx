## Declarations and consent

Break up legal declarations into separate paragraphs and consent checkboxes.

It’s easier for users to read and confirm their acceptance of the statements we provide.

### Example

For more information, see Legal guidance in How to create guidance in the Export Service.

## Error messages

You can use the following content patterns for common error messages in the Export Service.

### Examples

#### Broken link (404)

#### Removed page (404)

#### Planned maintenance (503)

#### Service unavailable (503)

#### Internal service error or outage (500)

#### Gateway timeout (504)

#### Third party outage (503)

You can use this error message content (or a variation of it) if a third-party provider experiences a system outage and their service is unavailable.

For example, Digital Identity or Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM).

## 'Need more help?' callouts

Use this pattern and content to give users the option to call the Export Service support desk.

Use ‘Need more help?’ as the heading. Not, ‘Need help?’ or ‘For more help’.

Make sure the Export Service phone number is accessible and linked. Don’t use bullet points or a colon after ‘Call’ or ‘Email’. Don’t use a full stop after the email address.

```jsx live
<Callout title="Need help?">
	<Prose>
		<p>
			Call <strong>000 000 000</strong> (9am to 5pm AEST Monday to Friday)
			<br />
			Email <a href="mailto:emailaccount@awe.gov.au">emailaccount@awe.gov.au</a>
		</p>
	</Prose>
</Callout>
```

For more information, see [Callout](/components/callout).
