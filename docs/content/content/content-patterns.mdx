## Declarations and consent

Break up legal declarations into separate paragraphs and consent checkboxes.

It’s easier for users to read and confirm their acceptance of the statements we provide.

### Example

For more information, see [Legal guidance in How to create guidance in the Export Service](/guides/how-to-write-guidance/how-to-present-guidance#legal-guidance).

## Error messages

You can use the following content patterns for common error messages in the Export Service.

### Not found (404)

You can use [this error message content](/storybook/index.html?path=/story/templates-error-page--not-found) if a user tries to access a page that doesn’t exist.

### Planned maintenance (503)

You can use [this error message content](/storybook/index.html?path=/story/templates-error-page--maintenance) if the Export Service is unavailable because of planned maintenance.

### Service unavailable (500)

You can use [this error message content](/storybook/index.html?path=/story/templates-error-page--server-error) if the Export Service is unavailable because of an internal service error or outage.

### Third party outage (503)

You can use [this error message content](/storybook/index.html?path=/story/templates-error-page--third-party) (or a variation of it) if a third-party provider experiences a system outage and their service is unavailable. For example, Digital Identity or Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM).

If the outage is scheduled, you can use the [scheduled maintenance error message content](/storybook/index.html?path=/story/templates-error-page--third-party).

## 'Need more help?' callouts

Use this pattern and content to give users the option to call the Export Service support desk.

Use ‘Need more help?’ as the heading. Not, ‘Need help?’ or ‘For more help’.

Make sure the Export Service phone number is accessible and linked. Don’t use bullet points or a colon after ‘Call’ or ‘Email’. Don’t use a full stop after the email address.

```jsx live enableProse
<Callout title="Need more help?">
	<Prose>
		<p>
			Call <strong>1800 571 125</strong>, Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm AEST
			<br />
			Email <a href="mailto:emailaccount@awe.gov.au">emailaccount@awe.gov.au</a>
		</p>
	</Prose>
</Callout>
```

For more information, see [Callout](/components/callout).
