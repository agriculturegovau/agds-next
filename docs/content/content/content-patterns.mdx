## Declarations and consent

Break up legal declarations into separate paragraphs and consent checkboxes.

It’s easier for users to read and confirm their acceptance of the statements we provide.

### Example

For more information, see Legal guidance in How to create guidance in the Export Service.

## Error messages

### Examples

## 'Need more help?' callouts

Use this pattern and content to give users the option to call the Export Service support desk.

Use ‘Need more help?’ as the heading. Not, ‘Need help?’ or ‘For more help’.

Make sure the Export Service phone number is accessible and linked. Don’t use bullet points or a colon after ‘Call’ or ‘Email’. Don’t use a full stop after the email address.

### Example

For more information, see [Callout](/components/callout).
