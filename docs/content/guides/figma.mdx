There are two Figma files supported and maintained by the Design System Team â€“ the AgDS design file and the AgDS master library file.

The **AgDS Design file** is intended for general use and contains everything you need to start designing quickly. All components, tokens for colour, border, space, font-styles, icons, patterns, and templates and helpful guidance is available in this file.

The **AgDS Master Library File** is the design system teams working file. All new components, bug fixes and patterns are developed here. You can view and copy this file, but we recommend you use the design file as it contains everything you need to get started quickly.

The fastest way to start designing, prototyping, testing your application is to copy the AgDS Design File into your team location. From there you will have edit access so you can copy the example components showcased in the Gallery, read design system guidance, or start consuming the components straight from the published library in the assets panel.

The Design System Component Library 2.0 is available in any Figma file you create in the Assets panel. Simply select the latest version and activate it to enable all current components in any file.
To access the Design file and install the library, you must have access to the [DAFF Figma organisation](https://www.figma.com/files/team/987658210083094931). For assistance please contact the Research Operations team.

The Figma Design File and Component Library can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/files/project/37217032/AgDS-Agriculture-Design-System?fuid=1049534194839136217).
