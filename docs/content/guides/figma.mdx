Figma is an interface design tool that allows you to create, test, and iterate on your designs collaboratively. It is used by the Design System team to create and maintain the AgDS, and is the tool of choice for designing and prototyping applications for the Export Service.

A Figma account will be created for you as part of your onboading process with the Department. It will match your agriculture email address. This account will be added to our [DAFF Figma organisation](https://www.figma.com/files/team/987658210083094931), which will give you access to the AgDS library and Design file.

For assistance with Figma accounts, please contact the Research Operations team.

## About the Figma files

The **AgDS Figma File** contains all of the components, colours, icons, and font-styles needed to build applications for the Export Service. It also contains a gallery of examples of common components variants, and is where the **AgDS Figma Component Library** is published from.

The **AgDS Component development and testing file** is the Design System Team's working file. All new components, bug fixes and patterns are developed here. Please get in touch if you would like to contribute.

## Get started

The fastest way to start designing, prototyping, testing your application is to copy the AgDS Design File into your team location. From there you will have edit access so you can copy the example components showcased in the Gallery, read design system guidance, or start consuming the components straight from the published library in the assets panel.

Alternatively, you can create a new blank Figma file in your project or draft folder, and enable the DAWE Figma asset library v1.20 to access the components and tokens. You can copy compositions in the Gallery and Templates pages of the AgDS Design file, and use them to create compositions for your product.

The Design System Component Library 2.0 is available in any Figma file you create in the Assets panel. Simply select the latest version and activate it to enable all current components in any file.

The Figma Design File and Component Library can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/files/project/37217032/AgDS-Agriculture-Design-System?fuid=1049534194839136217).
