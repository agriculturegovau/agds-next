## About the Figma files

There are two Figma files supported and maintained by the Design System Team â€“ the AgDS design file and the AgDS master library file.

The **AgDS Design file** is intended for general use and contains everything you need to start designing quickly. All components, tokens for colour, border, space, font-styles, icons, patterns, and templates and helpful guidance is available in this file. It also has a gallery of great examples of Design System components.

The **AgDS Master Library File** is the design system teams working file. All new components, bug fixes and patterns are developed here. You can view and copy this file, but we recommend you use the design file as it contains everything you need to get started quickly.

## Figma access

A Figma account will be created for you as part of your onboading process with the Department. It will match your agriculture email address. This account will be added to our [DAFF Figma organisation](https://www.figma.com/files/team/987658210083094931), which will give you access to the AgDS library and Design file.

For assistance with Figma accounts, please contact the Research Operations team.

## Get started

The fastest way to start designing, prototyping, testing your application is to copy the AgDS Design File into your team location. From there you will have edit access so you can copy the example components showcased in the Gallery, read design system guidance, or start consuming the components straight from the published library in the assets panel.

Alternatively, you can create a new blank Figma file in your project or draft folder, and enable the DAWE Figma asset library v1.20 to access the components and tokens. You can copy compositions in the Gallery and Templates pages of the AgDS Design file, and use them to create compositions for your product.

The Design System Component Library 2.0 is available in any Figma file you create in the Assets panel. Simply select the latest version and activate it to enable all current components in any file.

The Figma Design File and Component Library can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/files/project/37217032/AgDS-Agriculture-Design-System?fuid=1049534194839136217).
