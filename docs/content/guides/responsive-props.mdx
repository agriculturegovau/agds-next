title: Responsive props
overview: AgDS provides first class support for mobile-first responsive styles.
opener: The Agriculture Design System provides first class support for mobile-first responsive styles. Instead of manually writing CSS media queries throughout your codebase, our primitive components allow you to provide arrays and objects to generate responsive styles in your project.
---

## Breakpoints

Our responsive style APIs are based on the global [Breakpoint tokens](/foundations/tokens/breakpoints). Each key in the object refers to the breakpoint name, and each value refers to the the minimum width of the breakpoint.

> We use the `@media (min-width)` syntax to ensure styles are generated for mobile-first.

## Using responsive props

To use responsive props, you can pass an object to any prop that supports responsive values.

Here we've made a simple Box, and passed an object to the `padding` prop. The keys in the object refer to the breakpoint name.

```tsx live showCode
<Box background="shade" padding={{ xs: 1, sm: 2, md: 4 }}>
	Hello world
</Box>
```

Under the hood, this simple example has generated the following CSS:

```css
.css-1ped26i {
	padding: 1rem;
}

@media (min-width: 576px) {
	.css-1ped26i {
		padding: 2rem;
	}
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
	.css-1ped26i {
		padding: 4rem;
	}
}
```

We map each value in the object to a `min-width` media query.

## The array syntax

You can also define responsive styles as an array. To interpret array responsive values, we convert the values defined in our `breakpoints` token and sort them in ascending order.

To skip certain breakpoints, you can pass `null` to any item in the array to avoid generating unnecessary CSS.

```tsx live showCode
<Box background="shade" padding={[1, 2, 4]}>
	Hello world
</Box>
```

## CSS-in-JS

There can be situations where the primitive components don't support all of the props you need. In these cases, you can use our breakpoints in your CSS-in-JS styles.

You can add the `mq` and `mapResponsiveProp` functions to add styles at specific breakpoints.

```tsx
import { tokens } from '@ag.ds-next/react/core';

function AppLayoutGrid({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
	return (
		<div
			css={mq({
				display: 'grid',
				// The value here changes depending on the viewport
				gridTemplateColumns: mapResponsiveProp({
					xs: '1fr',
					xl: '17.5rem 1fr',
				}),
			})}
		>
			{children}
		</div>
	);
}
```

Or you can use the `mediaQuery` tokens from `Core` to add styles at specific breakpoints.

```tsx
import { tokens } from '@ag.ds-next/react/core';

export function AppLayoutHeader() {
	return (
		<Flex
			flexDirection="column"
			css={{
				// use the 'minimum width' mediaQuery tokens from Core.
				// This resolves to `@media (min-width: 1200px)`
				[tokens.mediaQuery.min.xl]: {
					gridColumnStart: 1,
					gridColumnEnd: 3,
				},
			}}
		>
			...
		</Flex>
	);
}
```
