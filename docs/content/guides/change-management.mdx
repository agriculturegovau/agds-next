opener: How we classify and communicate changes to our systems
---

When contributing changes to the system, it is important to understand how we classify and communicate them. This helps us to understand the impact of changes and to communicate them to our users.

## Change Types

We classify changes into three types:

- Patch
- Minor
- Major

### Patch (fix)

A change that fixes a bug or makes a small improvement which does not affect the API of the component. The consumer isn't expected to change their code in order to implement the update.

For example...

- A minor visual change to a component
- Resolving a crash or other kind of bug

The PR can merged and released as soon as a AgDS team member is free.

### Minor (feature)

A new feature to an existing component, or the introduction of a new standalone component. The user can elect to implement the change but isn't forced to change existing code.

For example...

- A new component
- A new prop on an existing component

The PR can merged and released as soon as a AgDS team member is free.

### Major (breaking)

A change which breaks the API of existing component(s). A user is expected to make a change to their code in order for it to continue working.

For example

- Removing a component
- Removing a prop from a component
- Changing the API, behaviour or name of a component

**Before this can be merged**, the community must be given a chance to give feedback on the change. The PR should be opened as a draft and the community should be notified in the "Design System" chat in Microsoft Teams. The PR should remain open for at least one week.

## About Changesets

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to communicate the changes to our users and to automate the release process.

Every pull request which changes a component must include a changeset file. This file describes the change, and is used to generate the release notes and to determine the version number of the next release.

To create a changeset, run `yarn changset` in the root of the repository. Then commit the changeset file and push it to your branch.
