## How to use it

This guide will help you create clear and consistent guidance in the Export Service.

Good content makes it easier for exporters to understand what they need to do when using our platform.

It will also help you understand the role of Export Service guidance and its relationship to support.

## Who can use it

This guide is a resource for people working with content in:

- [Export Service](https://agriculture-exports.awe.gov.au) delivery teams, like content designers and interaction designers

- [Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/) (DAFF) teams, like business, policy and
  communications stakeholders

- other government agency teams who work with the Export Service, like [Austrade](https://www.austrade.gov.au/).

It focuses on the Digital Services to Take Farmers to Markets (TFTM) program and Export Service context.

But it should align with usage across [Busting Congestion](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/budget-2020-21-busting-congestion-for-agricultural-exporters.pdf), DAFF and wider government. It’s important to provide our end users with consistent and [Connected experiences](./types-of-content#connected-experiences) across government services.

Please note, this guide and the Agriculture Design System’s [Content](/content) section is not for use for DAFF staff engaged in regulatory work for agricultural exports.

These users require knowledge products that support good regulatory outcomes. For example, training packages and instructional materials.

You can find regulatory guidance in the Export Regulatory Knowledge Hub (internal DAFF staff only). Access the hub on DAFF’s intranet site, The source.

## User needs

Users of the Export Service need to feel:

- they are doing the right thing when they complete an Export Service task
- confident that they understand the legal and regulatory requirements for the transaction, and that they are meeting those requirements.

The stakes for users can be high. They incur resource costs and face potential loss of market access if they don’t get the processes right.

This means our guidance and the online user experience must be:

- consistent
- clear
- comprehensive
- accurate
- accessible.
