## Export Service content

Export Service content provides online:

- transactions, and
- information to support the transactions.

We help users ‘do the thing’ in the [Export Service](https://exports.agriculture.gov.au/) by providing transactions securely in the account authenticated space. For example, to register an establishment.

We provide information to support most transactions in the [Export Service Help](https://exports.agriculture.gov.au/help) section.

You can find guidance on how to create content in the Export Service in several places. Get started with the pages in this How to create guidance in the Export Service guide.

Use it together with the following resources that form our Digital guidance toolkit. They offer more detail on all aspects of creating content that meets users’ needs in the Export Service:

- [AgDS Content section](/content)
- DAFF Style guide (internal DAFF staff only)
- [Australian Government Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/)

You can access the DAFF Style guide on DAFF’s SharePoint intranet site, The source. To find the guide, select About the department > Forms and templates > Department style guide.

If content guidance differs between these sources, follow guidelines in the above order.

## DAFF website content

[The Export section of the DAFF website](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/export) provides online information about exporting.

It helps users understand a topic or process, make informed decisions and prepare what they need before they ‘do the thing’ in the Export Service.

The [Export](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/export) section of the DAFF website provides details on:

- exporting legislation and regulation
- importing country requirements
- compliance, licensing, and documentation
- general information about consignments and quotas (as opposed to specific consignment and quota information as found on the Export Service)
- support packages for small exporters
- levy, fee and charging systems and guidelines.

## Connected experiences

The Export Service and the DAFF website should work together to provide a seamless and connected user experience.

Keep the users’ end-to-end journey and experience in mind when you create Export Service content. If it’s relevant, consider how to best connect to content in the:

- [Export section of the DAFF website](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/export)
- [Export Service unauthenticated space](https://exports.agriculture.gov.au/)
- Export Service account authenticated space.

If you need to provide context or detail to support Export Service content, try not to duplicate DAFF website content. Instead, link to the authoritative source.
