## Usage guidelines

- Try to limit forms to a single question per page (a question could include multiple related fields).
- Place the [Progress indicator component](/components/progress-indicator) in left column.
- The mobile version of the [Progress indicator](/components/progress-indicator) compresses into accordion to ensure it's not in the way of filling out the form.
- Avoid using disabled buttons in the [Progress indicator](/components/progress-indicator).
- Avoid adding or removing dynamic list items in [Progress indicator](/components/progress-indicator).
- Include a sub heading above the [H1](/components/heading) to tie form steps together.
- Include a [Button group](/components/button#button-groups) at the bottom.
- Ensure primary button text is contextual, and consistent with the page heading - e.g 'Register establishment'. Avoid vague labels such as 'Submit'.
- Hide [Breadcrumbs](/components/breadcrumbs) and [Side nav](/components/side-nav) to create focus on the form and reduce distractions.
- Include a 'back' link at the top.

### Rationale behind having the 'back' link at the top:

- It's a familiar position for the back button on mobile and web browsers.
- It's a conventional position for secondary navigation - breadcrumbs and back button.
- People can quickly go back to check the previous form.
- There's less chance of people going back and losing a filled form by mistake.
- It minimises the time for a user to proceed by reducing options near primary actions.
- It maintains accurate visual hierarchy making the back action less prominent than the primary action 'Continue'.
