The error page template can be used when a page cannot be found, or when there is a server error. It is comprised of the following components:

- A Heading (H1) which summarises the error
- Body text which describes the error
- The error code
- A button to attempt to rectify the error (optional)
- A red error icon at the top of the page (only applicable within apps that use the [App layout](/components/app-layout) component).

## Content

For guidance on writing content for the error page, or to see a list of approved examples, see [content patterns](/content/content-patterns#error-pages).

## Error icon usage

The red error icon should only be used within apps which use the [App layout](/components/app-layout) component, such as the authenticated experience for the Export Service. It should not be used within informational websites which use the more conventional website layout.
