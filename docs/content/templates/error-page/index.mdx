This can be used when a [page cannot be found](#page-not-found), or when there is a [server error](#server-error).

### How it works

The content should be clear and concise, and should not blame the user.

Do not use:

- breadcrumbs
- technical jargon like 404 or bad request
- informal or humorous words like oops
- red text to warn people

The page should have:

- information relevant to the error if it is something the user can act on.
- contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need.

Contact information should either:

- be a link to a specific page that includes numbers and opening times
- include all numbers and opening times

## Page not found

Use a page not found if someone is trying to view a page that does not exist. This happens if someone:

- selects a link or button that takes them to a page that does not exist
- types or copies a web address for a page that does not exist
- types or copies a web address incorrectly
- Test all links and buttons to make sure they work.

The page should have a heading of "Page not found" as the H1.

## Server Error

Use the server error page when the server has experienced an error and cannot recover.
