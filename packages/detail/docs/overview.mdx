description: A disclosure widget for supplimental information that explains a component, section or flow.
group: Layout
storybookPath: /story/layout-detail--basic

Information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. Unlike Accordion, inner content is surfacable in a page search (cmd/ctrl-f).

```jsx live
<Detail label='Details'>
  <Text>
    This is a small paragraph of text that is supplimentary to the main page
    content.
  </Text>
</Detail>
```
