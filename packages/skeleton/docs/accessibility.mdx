Skeleton components are not read out to screen readers by default, so it is important for you to provide meaningful context for screen reader users.

By using the [VisuallyHidden](/packages/a11y#visuallyhidden) component, we can indicate to screen readers that an element is in a loading state.

```jsx live
<Card shadow>
	<CardInner>
		<Stack gap={1}>
			<SkeletonHeading type="h3" width="50%" />
			<SkeletonText fontSize="sm" width="25%" />
			<VisuallyHidden>Loading</VisuallyHidden>
		</Stack>
	</CardInner>
</Card>
```
