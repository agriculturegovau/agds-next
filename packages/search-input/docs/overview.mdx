The `SearchInput` component can be used as a filter to aid the user in finding content that has already been loaded on the page.

For use cases where you need a search form with a submit button, the [Search Box](/components/search-box) component can be used instead.

## Default

By default, the `SearchInput` component does not expand to fill the available space.

```jsx live
<SearchInput label="Search" />
```

## Block

Use the `block` prop to expand the component to fill the available space.

```jsx live
<SearchInput label="Search" block />
```

## Required

The `required` prop can be used to indicate that user input is required on the field before a form can be submitted.

Using the `required` prop, this component will automatically append "(optional)" to the label as well as using [aria-required](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-required) to indicate to screen reader user that the field is required.

### Hide optional label

The `hideOptionalLabel` prop can be used in situations where you want to indiciate to screen reader users that a field is optional but don't want to show the "(optional)" label.

The usage of `hideOptionalLabel` should be reserved for inputs that filter data in a table or chart, and should never be used in standard forms for submitting information.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<SearchInput label="Required" required />
	<SearchInput label="Optional" required={false} />
	<SearchInput
		label="Optional with hideOptionalLabel"
		required={false}
		hideOptionalLabel={true}
	/>
</Stack>
```

## Invalid

Use the `invalid` prop to indicate if the user input is invalid (does not validate according to the elements settings).

```jsx live
<SearchInput
	label="Invalid"
	invalid
	message="A search term is required to see results"
/>
```

## Disabled

Disabled input elements are unusable and can not be clicked. This prevents a user from interacting with the input element until another action is complete.

```jsx live
<SearchInput label="Search" disabled />
```
