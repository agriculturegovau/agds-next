Documentation for this package can be found here: https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages/content/summary-list


SummaryList displays a list of terms and descriptions as key value pairs. It is similar to a two-column table, but renders a HTML Description List (`<dl>`) element.

Common uses for this component are to implement a glossary or to display metadata.
