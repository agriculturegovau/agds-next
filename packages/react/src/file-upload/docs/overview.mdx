```jsx live
<FileUpload
	label="Avatar image"
	hint="Formats accepted: .png, .jpg, .jpeg"
	multiple={false}
	accept={['image/jpeg', 'image/png']}
/>
```

File upload is used in forms to enable users to upload files they need. There are 2 ways to upload â€“ via drag and drop or file selection via search.

`FileUpload` is a [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).

<DoHeading />

- upload selected files instantly as they are selected or on submission
- specify accepted file types, maximum file size and whether the user can upload one file at a time or several at once
- include hint text to provide more general information about the field/file
- indicate file uploading state
- indicate a successful file upload using a [Page alert](/components/page-alert), including file name
- indicate unsuccessful file uploads using a [Page alert](/components/page-alert) with a meaningful error message, solution and support contact
- Make use of the 'instant upload' pattern if your backend supports it
- Consider the 'simple download' pattern for small screens

<DontHeading />

- add a standalone Submit file button inside a form
- include other unrelated fields on the page
- use in modals or page alerts
- change the default behaviour of the component by adding a standalone upload file button.

## Indicating upload status

When using FileUpload, you need to consider how to communicate to the user that the upload is in progress. Otherwise the page will appear "frozen" as the operation happens in the background.

### Uploading on submission

In this example, we are submitting a file as part of a typical form submission to an API.

We recommend wrapping the FileUpload in a [LoadingBlanket](/components/loading) component as the form submits, to indicate to the user that any delays are being caused by a potentially larger file being uploaded. If your backend system supports it, you can also use this UI to indicate upload status as a percentage.

As normal, we indicate that the form is submitting by adding a `loading={true}` to the submit button. This will show animated dots to signify that the user has to wait for the operation to complete.

```jsx live
<FormStack>
	<div style={{ position: 'relative' }}>
		<FileUpload
			label="Avatar image"
			hint="Formats accepted: .png, .jpg, .jpeg"
			multiple={false}
			accept={['image/jpeg', 'image/png']}
		/>
		<LoadingBlanket label="Uploading file (53%)" />
	</div>
	<div>
		<Button loading={true}>Submit</Button>
	</div>
</FormStack>
```

### Uploading files instantly

In this example, the file is instantly uploaded to a file hosting service, and the URL of the uploaded asset would be added to the form for submission. This means the form should not be allowed to submit until all assets are uploaded, but that the submission should be very quick as it's only text content being submitted.

`FileUpload` component allows you to indicate the status of an upload via a `file.status` property.

```jsx live
() => {
	const uploadedFile = createExampleImageFile({ status: 'success' });
	const uploadingFile = createExampleFile({ status: 'uploading' });
	return (
		<FileUpload
			label="Avatar image"
			hint="Formats accepted: .png, .jpg, .jpeg"
			multiple={false}
			accept={['image/jpeg', 'image/png']}
			value={[uploadedFile, uploadingFile]}
			onChange={console.log}
		/>
	);
};
```

## Multiple files

Selecting multiple files is also supported with FileUpload. Simply add `multiple={true}`, and you can select as many files as you want. You can also set `maxFiles` to limit how many files can be selected.

```jsx
<FileUpload multiple={true} maxFiles={3} />
```

## Maximum file size

Use the `maxSize` prop to set a maximum size for each file. This value is measured in kilobytes (kB).

```jsx
<FileUpload maxSize={200} /> // 200kB
<FileUpload maxSize={20000} /> // 20MB
```

## Hiding thumbnails

By default, the `FileUpload` component will render a preview of every selected file.

To disable this behaviour, set the `hideThumbnails` prop to `true`.

```jsx
<FileUpload hideThumbnails={true} />
```

## Accepted files

Use the `accept` prop to specify what file types are allowed to be selected.

For a complete list allowed file formats, please refer to [the source code](https://github.com/agriculture-gov-au/agds-next/blob/main/packages/react/src/file-upload/utils.tsx).

```jsx
<FileUpload label="Upload image" accept={['image/jpeg', 'image/png']} />
```

### Custom accepted file types

If the file type you need to support isn't list of allowed file formats, you can pass in your own file type to the `accept` prop.

This can be done by passing an object instead of a string with `mimeType` and `extensions` as keys. Optionally, a `label` key can be used for the summary inside of the component. By default, the label will be generated using the file extension.

```jsx
<FileUpload
	label="Upload JavaScript file"
	accept={[{ mimeType: 'text/javascript', extensions: ['.js'] }]}
/>
```

## Existing files

You can display a list of files that have already been uploaded by using the `existingFiles` and `onRemoveExistingFile` props.

Unlike the `value`prop, which expects an array of `File` objects, `existingFiles` expects an array of objects with a name, size and thumbnail url.

If a user attempts to delete an existing file, a destructive confirmation modal should be displayed. If confirmed, the file should be deleted on the server.

Image files should be displayed with thumbnails which are 72px by 72px. Passing full-size images will to `thumbnailSrc` prop will result with long load times.

```jsx live
<FileUpload
	label="Upload documents"
	existingFiles={[
		{
			name: 'example.png',
			size: 123456,
			thumbnailUrl: 'https://via.placeholder.com/150',
			href: '#',
			// Use the meta key to keep track of any extra file info
			// This can be useful info when deleting the file
			meta: { uid: 'abc-def', bucketId: '123-456' },
		},
	]}
	onRemoveExistingFile={(fileToRemove) => {
		console.log('Remove existing file', fileToRemove);
	}}
/>
```
