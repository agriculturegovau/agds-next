```jsx live
<FileUpload
	label="Avatar image"
	hint="Formats accepted: .png, .jpg."
	multiple={false}
	accept={['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png']}
/>
```

`FileUpload` is a [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).

<DoHeading />

- provide the accepted file types, maximum file size and whether the user can upload one file at a time or several at once
- include hint text to provide information about the field
- indicate file uploading state
- indicate successful file upload
- indicate unsuccessful file uploads with a meaningful error message.

<DontHeading />

- use for multiple files in modals or page alerts
- add a standalone Submit file button inside a form
- include other fields on the page
- make File upload a mandatory field.

## Indicating upload status

When using FileUpload, you need to consider how the communicate to the user that the upload is in progress. Otherwise the page will appear "frozen" as the operation happens in the background.

### Uploading on submission

In this example, we are submitting a file as part of a typical form submission to an API.

We recommend wrapping the FileUpload in a LoadingBanner as the form submits, to indicate to the user that any delays are being caused by a potentially larger file being uploaded. If your backend system supports it, you can also use this UI to indicate upload status as a percentage.

As normal, we indicate that the form is submitting by adding a `loading={true}` to the submit button. This will show animated dots to signify that the user has to wait for the operation to complete.

```jsx live
<FormStack>
	<div style={{ position: 'relative' }}>
		<FileUpload
			label="Avatar image"
			hint="Formats accepted: .png, .jpg."
			multiple={false}
			accept={['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png']}
		/>
		<LoadingBlanket label="Uploading file (53%)" />
	</div>
	<div>
		<Button loading>Submit</Button>
	</div>
</FormStack>
```

### Uploading files instantly

In this example, the file is instantly uploaded to a file hosting service, and the URL of the uploaded asset would be added to the form for submission. This means the form should not be allowed to submit until all assets are uploaded, but that the submission should be very quick as it's only text content being submitted.

`FileUpload` component allows you to indicate the status of an upload via a `file.status` property.

```jsx live
() => {
	const uploadingFile = new File(['this is an example file'], 'example.jpg', {
		type: 'image/jpg',
	});
	uploadingFile.status = 'uploading';
	const uploadedFile = new File(
		['this is another example file that has uploaded'],
		'example.jpg',
		{
			type: 'image/jpg',
		}
	);
	uploadedFile.status = 'success';
	return (
		<FileUpload
			label="Avatar image"
			hint="Formats accepted: .png, .jpg."
			multiple={false}
			accept={['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png']}
			value={[uploadedFile, uploadingFile]}
			onChange={console.log}
		/>
	);
};
```

## Props

### Multiple files

Selecting multiple files is also supported with FileUpload. Simply add `multiple={true}`, and you can select as many files as you want. You can also set `maxFiles` to limit how many files can be selected.

```jsx
<FileUpload multiple={true} maxFiles={3} />
```

### Maximum size

Use the `maxSize` prop to set a maximum size for each file. This value is measured in kB.

```jsx
<FileUpload maxSize={200} /> // 200kB
<FileUpload maxSize={20000} /> // 20MB
```

- `application/msword`
- `application/pdf`
- `application/rtf`
