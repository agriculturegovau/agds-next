## StatusBadge

```jsx live
<Flex flexWrap="wrap" gap={1}>
	<StatusBadge tone="info" label="In progress" />
	<StatusBadge tone="success" label="Resolved" />
	<StatusBadge tone="error" label="Rejected" />
	<StatusBadge tone="warning" label="Attention" />
	<StatusBadge tone="neutral" label="Draft" />
</Flex>
```

Use `StatusBadge` to highlight an item's status for quick recognition.

Choosing a `tone` for StatusBadge allows the user to understand the importance and severity of the message at a glance.

The five supported tones are `info`, `success`, `error`, `warning` and `neutral`.

<DoHeading />

- use to indicate the status of a task or process
- use to help users differentiate between multiple statuses

<DontHeading />

- use status badge without an icon
- change the colours or create new ones
- use when colour and icon don't convey meaning.

## NotificationBadge

```jsx live
<Flex gap={1}>
	<NotificationBadge tone="neutral" value={16} />
	<NotificationBadge tone="action" value={8} />
	<NotificationBadge tone="action" max={99} value={123} />
</Flex>
```

A notification badge is a visual indicator for numeric values.

Use the `max` property where the count is expected to exceed a reasonable number, and the exact count is not particularly valuable to the user.

<DoHeading />

- use to indicate numeric values such as message count
- place next to associated content – for example, Messages (1)

<DontHeading />

- change the colours or create new ones

## IndicatorDot

A small decorative indicator used to call attention to an item, such as an unread message.

```jsx live
<IndicatorDot />
```

An IndicatorDot should not be used on its own, as it gives no context. It should instead be considered as part of a wider composition.

```jsx live
<Flex flexDirection="column" as="ul">
	<Flex
		as="li"
		aria-selected="false"
		borderColor="muted"
		borderY
		css={{
			backgroundColor: boxPalette.systemInfoMuted,
		}}
		flexDirection="column"
		gap={0.5}
		justifyContent="space-between"
		padding={1.5}
		width="100%"
	>
		<Flex justifyContent="space-between">
			<Text fontSize="md" fontWeight="bold">
				Action required
			</Text>

			<Flex alignItems="center" gap={0.5}>
				<Text color="muted">10:15am</Text>
				<IndicatorDot tone="action" />
				<VisuallyHidden>Unread message</VisuallyHidden>
			</Flex>
		</Flex>

		<Text fontSize="sm">

			information. Please provide your ABN/ACN by 12 June 2022 to avoid delays.
		</Text>

		<div>
			<TextLink href="#details">View details</TextLink>
		</div>
	</Flex>
</Flex>
```

<DoHeading />
