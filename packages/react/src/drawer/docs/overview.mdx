<DoHeading />

- read the [Filtering a dataset pattern](/patterns/filtering-a-dataset)
- use a [Button group](/components/button#button-group) to display actions
- include a "Close" button in the top right
- include a meaningful title - e.g. "Filter by"
- close the Drawer when an action are pressed (optional)

<DontHeading />

- remove the "Close" button
- remove the overlay
- change default behaviour

## Opening the Drawer

When the Drawer is opened, an overlay is displayed over the main area of the page. This prevents the main area of the page from being interactive.

## Closing the Drawer

The Drawer can be closed by either:

1. Pressing the "Close" button
2. Pressing the "Escape" key
3. Pressing the overlay
4. Pressing a button in the actions area (optional)

When closing the Drawer, focus should be returned to the button that opened the Drawer.
