Fieldset is used to associate a number of related form fields as well as labels within a form. The legend provides an association and caption for the form fields in the fieldset.

```jsx live
<Fieldset
	legend="What is your address?"
	hint="We will only use this to respond to your request"
>
	<FormStack>
		<TextInput
			label="Street and number"
			required
			autoComplete="street-address"
			maxWidth="xl"
		/>
		<TextInput
			label="Suburb"
			required
			autoComplete="address-level2"
			maxWidth="xl"
		/>
		<TextInput label="Country" required autoComplete="country" maxWidth="xl" />
		<TextInput
			label="Postcode"
			required
			autoComplete="postal-code"
			maxWidth="sm"
		/>
	</FormStack>
</Fieldset>
```

### Legend as page heading

If you’re asking just one question per page, you can set the contents of the `legend` as the page heading, as shown in the example below. This is good practice as it means that users of screen readers will only hear the contents once.

```jsx live
<Fieldset
	legend={<H1>What is your date of birth?</H1>}
	hint={
		<Text as="p" fontSize="md" color="muted">
			We will only use this to respond to your requests
		</Text>
	}
>
	<FormStack>
		<TextInput
			label="Day"
			inputMode="numeric"
			maxWidth="md"
			required
			autoComplete="bday-day"
		/>
		<TextInput
			label="Month"
			inputMode="numeric"
			maxWidth="md"
			required
			autoComplete="bday-month"
		/>
		<TextInput
			label="Year"
			inputMode="numeric"
			maxWidth="md"
			required
			autoComplete="bday-year"
		/>
	</FormStack>
</Fieldset>
```
