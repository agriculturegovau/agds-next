```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<Box background="shade" padding={1} />
	<Box background="shade" padding={1} />
	<Box background="shade" padding={1} />
</Stack>
```

## As prop

By default, the Stack component renders a HTML `<div>` element. You can render it with a different HTML element tag by using the `as` prop.

```jsx live
<Stack as="section" gap={1}>
	<Box background="shade" padding={1} />
	<Box background="shade" padding={1} />
	<Box background="shade" padding={1} />
</Stack>
```

## Box props

Stack supports all of the `BoxProps` from the box component (except for display). For more information, see [Box props](/components/box/code).

## Responsive props

The Stack component supports the responsive prop syntax on most props. For more information about responsive props, see the [responsive props guide](/guides/responsive-props).
