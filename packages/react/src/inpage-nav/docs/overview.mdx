The Inpage nav (or Page contents) is placed at the top of a page and consists of anchor links that guide users to page sections.

The Inpage nav should be used in combination with ‘Back to top’ links using [Direction links](/components/direction-link) at the end of sections to help users return to the Inpage nav on long pages.

The solid left-hand border visually separates the component from the page content.

<DoHeading />

- use to improve discoverability by allowing users to skip sections they do not need
- ensure the anchor link text and section title are the same
- use unique, accurate headings to describe section content
- use for longer pages as a table of contents
- use ‘Back to top’ links using [Direction links](/components/direction-link) at the end of sections to help users return to the Inpage nav on long pages.

<DontHeading />

- use to navigate to another page – consider a [Text link](/components/text-link) or [Link list](/components/link-list).
