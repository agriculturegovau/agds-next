## Purpose:

An accordion is an expandable section with nested content. This component provides details when opened by users on a content page. It can help to streamline the user experience by keeping content relevant to the user.

Pathway accordion items contains a series of links to both internal and external site pages.

## When to use this component:

Used on guide landing pages to provide links to related content on business.gov.au.
Can also be used to collate a collection of links to other sites. e.g Covid-19 support sites.

## Content rules

When used in the context of a guide landing page the pathway tiles within accordion items MUST have 'required' or 'recommended' tags.
Pathway accordion items should only contain pathway tiles. They should not contain body copy.
