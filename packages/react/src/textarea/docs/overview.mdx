```jsx live
<Textarea label="Message" />
```

By default, the `Textarea` component does not expand to fill the available space.

<DoHeading />

- use for plain text descriptions and messages
- include help text above the input box
- include a clear label that tells users what information is required
- use for collecting multi-line plain text values
- use when asking for a description or feedback
- allow the user to use the resize handle
- specify if there is a maximum input length
- indicate if input is optional.

<DontHeading />

- use when a specific value is needed
- use for inputs that expect a single value or a couple of words.

## Block

Use the `block` prop to expand the component to fill the available space.

```jsx live
<Textarea label="Message" block />
```

## Required

The `required` prop can be used to indicate that user input is required on the field before a form can be submitted.

Using the `required` prop, this component will automatically append "(optional)" to the label as well as using [aria-required](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-required) to indicate to screen reader user that the field is required.

### Hide optional label

The `hideOptionalLabel` prop can be used in situations where you want to indiciate to screen reader users that a field is optional but don't want to show the "(optional)" label.

The usage of `hideOptionalLabel` should be reserved for inputs that filter data in a table or chart, and should never be used in standard forms for submitting information.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<Textarea label="Required" required />
	<Textarea label="Optional" required={false} />
	<Textarea
		label="Optional with hideOptionalLabel"
		required={false}
		hideOptionalLabel={true}
	/>
</Stack>
```

## Invalid

Use the `invalid` prop to indicate if the user input is invalid (does not validate according to the elements settings).

```jsx live
<Textarea label="Invalid" invalid message="This field is invalid" />
```

## Disabled

Disabled textarea elements are unusable and can not be clicked. This prevents a user from interacting with the textarea element until another action is complete. Disabled textarea elements in a form will not be submitted.

```jsx live
<Textarea label="Message" disabled />
```

## Maximum widths

The maximum width of a textarea should indicate the amount of information expected to be entered into the field. The size of the textarea acts as a visual constraint for the end user.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<Textarea label="md textarea" maxWidth="md" />
	<Textarea label="lg textarea" maxWidth="lg" />
	<Textarea label="xl textarea" maxWidth="xl" />
</Stack>
```
