## Structure

### Panel

Use short paragraphs or bullet lists and don’t use sub-heads.

Longer content may cause a scroll bar to appear and provide a bad user experience.

Make sure all panel content other than body text is accessible. For example, alt-text on images, column and table labels.

## Language

Refer to the glossary for general information on language.

### Voice and tone

Go to the [TFTM Voice and tone guide](/content/voice-and-tone) for guidance.
