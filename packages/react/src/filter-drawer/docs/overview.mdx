## Opening the Filter drawer

When the Filter drawer is opened, an overlay is displayed over the main area of the page. This prevents the main area of the page from being interactive.

## Closing the Filter drawer

The Filter drawer can be closed by either:

1. Pressing the "Close" button
2. Pressing the "Apply filters" button
3. Pressing the "Cancel" button
4. Pressing the "Escape" key
5. Pressing the overlay

When closing the Filter drawer, focus should be returned to the button that opened the Filter drawer.

## Actions

The Filter drawer component should contain a total of 4 actions:

1. **"Apply filters" button**: When a user presses the "Apply filters" button, filters should be applied and the Filter drawer should be closed.
2. **"Reset filters" button**: When a user presses the "Apply filters" button, filters should be reset to their original state. The Filter drawer should stay open.
3. **"Close" button**: When a user presses the "Close" button, the Filter drawer should close. Any changes that have been made since opening the Filter drawer should be discarded. This is essentially the same as the "Cancel" button.
4. **"Cancel" button**: When a user presses the "Cancel" button, the Filter drawer should close. Any changes that have been made since opening the Filter drawer should be discarded. This is essentially the same as the "Close" button.
