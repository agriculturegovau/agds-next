```jsx live
() => {
	const [isFilterDrawerOpen, openFilterDrawer, closeFilterDrawer] =
		useTernaryState(false);
	return (
		<React.Fragment>
			<Button onClick={openFilterDrawer}>Open FilterDrawer</Button>
			<FilterDrawer
				isOpen={isFilterDrawerOpen}
				onDismiss={closeFilterDrawer}
				title="Filter by"
				actions={
					<ButtonGroup>
						<Button onClick={closeFilterDrawer}>Apply filters</Button>
						<Button variant="secondary" onClick={closeFilterDrawer}>
							Reset filters
						</Button>
						<Button variant="tertiary" onClick={closeFilterDrawer}>
							Cancel
						</Button>
					</ButtonGroup>
				}
			>
				<Text as="p">This is the FilterDrawer Body.</Text>
			</FilterDrawer>
		</React.Fragment>
	);
};
```

The user can scroll through and interact with the vertical list of filter controls, which can include checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, and text fields. The filters are applied when the user clicks the Apply button.

When the user opens the FilterDrawer, the main page is dimmed and the FilterDrawer appears on the right edge of the screen. The user cannot interact with the main page while the FilterDrawer is open. The FilterDrawer can be closed by clicking the Close button or by clicking outside the FilterDrawer.
