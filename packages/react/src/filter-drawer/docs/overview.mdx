		useTernaryState(false);
	return (
		<React.Fragment>
			<Button onClick={openFilterDrawer}>Open Filter drawer</Button>
			<FilterDrawer
				isOpen={isFilterDrawerOpen}
				onDismiss={closeFilterDrawer}
				title="Filter by"
				actions={
					<ButtonGroup>
						<Button onClick={closeFilterDrawer}>Apply filters</Button>
						<Button variant="secondary" onClick={closeFilterDrawer}>
							Reset filters
						</Button>
						<Button variant="tertiary" onClick={closeFilterDrawer}>

	);
};
```

When the user opens the Filter drawer component, the main area of page is dimmed and the Filter drawer is overlayed on the right edge of the screen. When the Filter drawer is open, the main area of the page is not interactive.

<DoHeading />

- use to allow a user to filter a data list or table
- use a [Button group](/components/button#button-group) to display actions
- include a Close button in the top right corner
- closes the Filter drawer when filters are applied.

<DontHeading />

- remove the Close button
- remove the tinted overlay
- change default behaviour
- use for anything else besides filters.

## Closing the filter drawer

The Filter drawer can be closed by either:

1. Clicking the "Close" button
2. Clicking the "Apply filters" button
3. Clicking the "Cancel" button
4. Pressing the "Escape" key

The filter drawer does not close when clicking the overlay.

When closing the Filter drawer, focus should be returned to the button that opened the Filter drawer.

## Actions

When using this component, there should be a total of 4 actions.

### 1. "Apply filters" button

When a user presses the "Apply filters" button, filters should be applied and the Filter drawer should be closed.

### 2. "Reset filters" button

When a user presses the "Apply filters" button, filters should be reset to their original state. The Filter drawer should stay open.

### 3. "Close" button

When a user presses the "Cancel" button, the Filter drawer should close. Any changes that have been made since opening the Filter drawer should be discarded. This is essentially the same as the "Cancel" button.

### 4. "Cancel" button

When a user presses the "Cancel" button, the Filter drawer should close. Any changes that have been made since opening the Filter drawer should be discarded. This is essentially the same as the "Close" button.

## Filtering a data set pattern

Filters allows a user to refine the data they want to display in a large dataset by removing any items that do not match their criteria.
