```jsx live
<Details label="Details">
	<Text as="p">
		This is a small paragraph of text that is supplementary to the main page
		content.
	</Text>
</Details>
```

Information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. Unlike Accordion, inner content is surfacable in a page search (cmd/ctrl-f).

<DoHeading />

- use in forms to help explain information only some users need
- ensure links open on a new page
- position immediately after the related content
- use instead of Tool tip or Modal
- use instead of Accordion if there is only 1 section of content
- include a clear description
- use sparingly as they disrupt the user flow.

<DontHeading />

- use for important information
- use more than 1 per page.

## With icon

Setting the `iconBefore` prop to `true` will render the `InfoIcon` before the label.

```jsx live
<Details label="Details" iconBefore>
	<Text as="p">
		This is a small paragraph of text that is supplementary to the main page
		content.
	</Text>
</Details>
```
