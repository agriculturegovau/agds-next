```jsx live
<Details label="How does the 120-day processing time work?" iconBefore>
	<Text as="p">
		This is a small paragraph of text that is supplementary to the main page
		content.
	</Text>
</Details>
```

Information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an ‘open’ state. Unlike Accordion, inner content is discoverable in a page search (cmd/ctrl-f) in some browsers, like Google Chrome.

Details should only be used for 1 piece of content. If more sections are required, use an Accordion or Tab.

Setting the `iconBefore` prop to `true` will render the `InfoIcon` before the label.

<DoHeading />

- use in forms to help explain information only some users need
- position immediately after the related content
- use instead of tooltips or Modal where possible
- use short sentences
- include a clear description
- consider using an accordion if there are multiple paragraphs of content
- use sparingly, and only when users need additional information.

<DontHeading />

- use for information all users need to read
- include other components inside a Details area
- use a dark theme callout on a light theme.

## With icon

Setting the `iconBefore` prop to `true` will render the `InfoIcon` before the label.

```jsx live
<Details label="Details" iconBefore>
	<Text as="p">
		This is a small paragraph of text that is supplementary to the main page
		content.
	</Text>
</Details>
```

## On Body Alt

If the Details component is placed on a page with `bodyAlt` background, set the `onBodyAlt` prop to `true`. This ensures the correct shade background token is used by the component.

```jsx live
<Box background="bodyAlt" padding={1.5}>
	<Details label="Details" iconBefore onBodyAlt>
		<Text as="p">
			This is a small paragraph of text that is supplementary to the main page
			content.
		</Text>
	</Details>
</Box>
```
