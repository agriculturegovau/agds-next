```jsx live
<Details label="This is an example of a long label" iconBefore>
	<Text as="p">
		This is a small paragraph of text that is supplementary to the main page
		content.
	</Text>
</Details>
```

Information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an ‘open’ state. Unlike Accordion, inner content is discoverable in a page search (cmd/ctrl-f) in some browsers, like Google Chrome.

Details should only be used for 1 piece of content. If more sections are required, use an Accordion or Tab.

Setting the `iconBefore` prop to `true` will render the `InfoIcon` before the label.

<DoHeading />

- use sparingly, and only when users need additional information
- position the component before a form and avoid using it between between from controls
- position immediately after the related content
- use instead of tooltips or Modal where possible
- use short sentences
- include a clear description
- consider using an accordion if there are multiple paragraphs of content.

<DontHeading />

- hide crucial information
- include other components inside a Details area
- use a dark theme callout on a light theme.

## With icon

Setting the `iconBefore` prop to `true` will render the `InfoIcon` before the label.

```jsx live
<Details label="Details label" iconBefore>
	<Text as="p">
		This is a small paragraph of text that is supplementary to the main page
		content.
	</Text>
</Details>
```

## On Body Alt

If the Details component is placed on a page with `bodyAlt` background, set the `onBodyAlt` prop to `true`. This ensures the correct shade background token is used by the component.

```jsx live
<Box background="bodyAlt" padding={1.5}>
	<Details label="Details label" iconBefore onBodyAlt>
		<Text as="p">
			This is a small paragraph of text that is supplementary to the main page
			content.
		</Text>
	</Details>
</Box>
```

## Colour

```jsx live colorSection shadeAlt
<>
	<Box background="body" padding={1.5}>
		<Details label="Details: on [%_PALETTE_%] body background" iconBefore>
			<Text as="p">
				This is a small paragraph of text that is supplementary to the main page
				content.
			</Text>
		</Details>
	</Box>
	<Box background="bodyAlt" padding={1.5}>
		<Details label="Details: on [%_PALETTE_%] bodyAlt background" iconBefore>
			<Text as="p">
				This is a small paragraph of text that is supplementary to the main page
				content.
			</Text>
		</Details>
	</Box>
</>
```
