title: Details
description: A disclosure widget for supplimental information that explains a component, section or flow.
group: Content
storybookPath: /story/content-details--basic
---

Information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. Unlike Accordion, inner content is surfacable in a page search (cmd/ctrl-f).

```jsx live
<Details label="Details">
	<Text as="p">
		This is a small paragraph of text that is supplementary to the main page
		content.
	</Text>
</Details>
```

## With icon

Setting the `iconBefore` prop to `true` will render the `InfoIcon` before the label.

```jsx live
<Details label="Details" iconBefore>
	<Text as="p">
		This is a small paragraph of text that is supplementary to the main page
		content.
	</Text>
</Details>
```
