Here are ways to make a Details component more accessible and inclusive of users of any ability or environment.

Be aware some users avoid detail links if they think they will lose their place in the flow if the page doesn't open in a new tab.

Consider that content inside the Detail does not print with the rest of the page.

Voice assist technology is unlikely to be able to read the content in the Detail.

For general help with accessibility, go to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
