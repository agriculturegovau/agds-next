Here are ways to make a Details component more accessible and inclusive for users of any ability or environment.

Be aware some users avoid detail links if they think they will lose their place in the flow if the page doesnâ€™t open in a new tab.

Consider that content inside the Detail does not print with the rest of the page.

For general help with accessibility, go to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
