<DoHeading />

- use to indicate the status of a task or process
- use to help users differentiate between multiple statuses
- apply the `subtle` weight in tables to reduce visual emphasis and overall height of the parent component

<DontHeading />

- use without an icon
- change the colours or create new ones
- use the `subtle` weight outside of tables or dense parent components
- use when colour and icon don’t convey meaning.

## Tone

Choosing a `tone` for Status badge allows the user to understand the importance and severity of the message at a glance. It automatically applies appropriate colour and iconography.

The five supported tones are `info`, `success`, `error`, `warning` and `neutral`.

```jsx live
<Flex flexWrap="wrap" gap={1}>
	<StatusBadge tone="info" label="In progress" />
	<StatusBadge tone="success" label="Resolved" />
	<StatusBadge tone="error" label="Rejected" />
	<StatusBadge tone="warning" label="Attention" />
	<StatusBadge tone="neutral" label="Draft" />
</Flex>
```

## Weight

Apply the `subtle` weight in tables to reduce visual emphasis and overall height of the parent component. The `subtle` weight can reduce complexity and repetition in dense compositions where multiple status badges are applied.

```jsx live
<Flex flexWrap="wrap" gap={2}>
	<StatusBadge weight="subtle" tone="info" label="In progress" />
	<StatusBadge weight="subtle" tone="success" label="Resolved" />
	<StatusBadge weight="subtle" tone="error" label="Rejected" />
	<StatusBadge weight="subtle" tone="warning" label="Attention" />
	<StatusBadge weight="subtle" tone="neutral" label="Draft" />
</Flex>
```
