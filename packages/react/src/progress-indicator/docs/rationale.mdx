Here are the reasons our progress indicators appear or work the way they do.

## Navigation

Progress indicators allow users to quickly navigate to any section of a multi-page task. Ensure the steps are displayed in the order in which users need to complete them.

## Save and exit

If a user saves and exits mid-task, the progress indicator shows them where they were up to when they resume. Users can return to any step at any time to review or change their information.

## Time management

Progress indicators enhance the user experience by indicating the time needed to complete the task.

## Cognitive load balancing

Try to balance interaction cost and cognitive load â€“ for example, 24 questions could be 6 pages of 4 questions, rather than 24 pages.
