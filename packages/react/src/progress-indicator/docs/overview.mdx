```jsx live

		{ label: 'Submit evidence', status: 'saved', href: '#evidence' },
		{ label: 'Organisations', status: 'started', href: '#organisations' },
		{ label: 'Business contacts', status: 'error', href: '#contacts' },
		{ label: 'Case studies', status: 'todo', href: '#case-studies' },

Progress indicators are used to help users navigate to each step of a multi-step form, show users how many steps are needed to complete and where they are in the process of completing it. This helps users know how much is left to do and how far along they are.

Progress indicators can be applied to larger tasks that can be completed in any order and returned to at a later date, like doing a tax return or applying for a driver’s licence.

Progress indicators can be applied to multi-step forms if the form has a known number of steps to be completed. <sup><a href="#cite-1">1</a></sup>

Avoid adding or removing pages to a multi-step form where a progress indicator is used as this can confuse and mislead users. Consider another approach if the number of steps might change due to user input. <sup><a href="#cite-2">2</a></sup>

By default, A Progress indicator contains links to each level 1 page of a multi-step flow.

When a user navigates to a secondary action page from a level 1 page, a nested level 2 link is revealed in the Progress indicator to help a user understand where they have navigated to and how to return to the previous step.

<DoHeading />

- display steps in order from top to bottom
- allow users to navigate to any step
- use in forms and multi-page processes
- use for processes of 2 - 10 steps
- always present the mobile menu closed by default
- pair with [Task list](/components/task-list) if nesting is required
- ensure step names match H1s and truncate if long
- frontload keywords
- group related steps.

<DontHeading />

- dynamically or conditionally change the number of steps in a progress indicator list
- use for fewer than 2 steps
- disable steps - allow users to navigate to pages and use Page alerts to indicate a step is not available yet
- have any other components in the left-hand column
- add the step number to the text - list only the action the user needs to take
- mix with other navigation patterns - for example, [Side nav](/components/side-nav)
- change labels or icons
- make progress indicators a sticky nav item as this may cause reading order issues.

## Background

The background of the Progress indicator must match the background it is being placed on.

If the Progress indicator is placed on a `bodyAlt` background, please set the `background` prop to `bodyAlt`.

## Status

The `status` prop can be used to indicate the status of each item. The following values are available:

<Table>
	<TableCaption>Available statuses for a Progress Indicator</TableCaption>
	<TableHead>
		<TableRow>
			<TableHeader scope="col">Status</TableHeader>
			<TableHeader scope="col">Label</TableHeader>
			<TableHeader scope="col">Description</TableHeader>
		</TableRow>
	</TableHead>
	<TableBody>
		<TableRow>
			<TableCell>
				<code>todo</code>
			</TableCell>
			<TableCell>Not started</TableCell>
			<TableCell>This step is available for the user to start.</TableCell>
		</TableRow>
		<TableRow>
			<TableCell>
				<code>started</code>
			</TableCell>
			<TableCell>In progress</TableCell>
			<TableCell>
				This step has been started and still needs to be completed.
			</TableCell>
		</TableRow>
		<TableRow>
			<TableCell>
				<code>done</code>
			</TableCell>
			<TableCell>Completed</TableCell>
			<TableCell>
				This step is complete. The user has submitted valid data and it has been
				verified (where necessary).
			</TableCell>
		</TableRow>
		<TableRow>
			<TableCell>
				<code>blocked</code>
			</TableCell>
			<TableCell>Cannot start yet</TableCell>
			<TableCell>
				This step is not yet available for the user to start.
			</TableCell>
		</TableRow>
		<TableRow>
			<TableCell>
				<code>saved</code>
			</TableCell>
			<TableCell>Saved</TableCell>
			<TableCell>
				This step has valid saved data that can still be changed.
			</TableCell>
		</TableRow>
		<TableRow>
			<TableCell>
				<code>error</code>
			</TableCell>
			<TableCell>Error</TableCell>
			<TableCell>This step has an error that requires attention.</TableCell>
		</TableRow>
	</TableBody>
</Table>

## Currently active item

To indicate the currently active item, whether level 1 or level 2, pass in a matching path to the `activePath` prop. E.g. `activePath="/organisations/change-name"`.

## Hiding the sub title

The Progress indicator component displays a subtitle "x of y steps completed" by default. To hide this subtitle, set the `hideSubtitle` prop to `true`.

```jsx live
<ProgressIndicator
	activePath="#organisations"
	hideSubtitle
	items={[
		{ href: '#introduction', label: 'Introduction', status: 'done' },
		{ href: '#organisations', label: 'Organisations', status: 'started' },
		{
			href: '#contacts',
			label: 'Business contacts',
			status: 'started',
		},
		{ href: '#case-studies', label: 'Case studies', status: 'todo' },
		{ href: '#attachments', label: 'Attachments', status: 'blocked' },
	]}
/>
```

## Adding level 2 steps

If one of the steps in a multi-step form has a secondary step, such as adding an employee with name and email to a list of employees, use a separate page for the secondary step. Let users know where they are by using a level 2 step in the progress indicator. A level 2 step sits under the main step. There can only be a single level 2 step for each main step.

```jsx live
<ProgressIndicator
	activePath="#organisations/add-organisation"
	hideSubtitle
	items={[
		{ href: '#introduction', label: 'Introduction', status: 'done' },
		{
			href: '#organisations',
			label: 'Organisations',
			status: 'started',
			items: [
				{
					label: 'Add an organisation',
					href: '#organisations/add-organisation',
				},
			],
		},
		{ href: '#review', label: 'Review and submit', status: 'blocked' },
	]}
/>
```

### An example of a level 2 step

Progress indicators contain level 1 links to each page of a multi-step form. When additional pages are required for secondary actions nested in level 1 pages, level 2 links are revealed in the Progress indicator to help a user understand where they have navigated to and how to return to the to the previous step.

<ImageWithBorder src="/img/progress-indicator-level-two--1.png" alt="" />

The level 2 step is separate page, so it is displayed under the main level 1 step in the progress indicator. This helps the user understand where they are in the process.

<ImageWithBorder src="/img/progress-indicator-level-two--2.png" alt="" />

Once the user saves their changes, they’re taken back to the main step page and a section alert is displayed to let them know that their changes were made successfully. The level 2 step is no longer displayed in the progress indicator. It’s only displayed when the user is on the level 2 step page.
