<DoHeading />

- always use the default gap/spacing value of `2rem (32px)`

<DontHeading />

- use this component outside of forms
- use any other gap/spacing value

## Basic usage

Below is a live code example of a simple form. In this example, notice how the `FormStack` component is being used to space out form elements evenly.

```jsx live
<form>
	<FormStack>
		<TextInput label="Email" type="email" maxWidth="xl" />
		<TextInput label="Password" type="password" maxWidth="xl" />
		<Divider />
		<ButtonGroup>
			<Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
			<Button type="button" variant="secondary">
				Cancel
			</Button>
		</ButtonGroup>
	</FormStack>
</form>
```
