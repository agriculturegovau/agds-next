A simple input for selecting files in a form. The `FileInput` component is a wrapper around the native `<input type="file" />` element. Use when you require multiple files in a form, which must be associated as seperate fields. If you only require a single file, use the [FileUpload](/components/file-upload) component instead.

```jsx live
<FormStack>
	<FileInput label="Drivers license" required />
	<FileInput label="Passport" required />
</FormStack>
```

## Required

The `required` prop can be used to indicate that user input is required on the field before a form can be submitted.

Using the `required` prop, this component will automatically append "(optional)" to the label as well as using [aria-required](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-required) to indicate to screen reader user that the field is required.

### Hide optional label

The `hideOptionalLabel` prop can be used in situations where you want to indiciate to screen reader users that a field is optional but don't want to show the "(optional)" label.

The usage of `hideOptionalLabel` should be reserved for inputs that filter data in a table or chart, and should never be used in standard forms for submitting information.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<FileInput label="Required" required />
	<FileInput label="Optional" required={false} />
	<FileInput
		label="Optional with hideOptionalLabel"
		required={false}
		hideOptionalLabel={true}
	/>
</Stack>
```

## Invalid

Use the `invalid` prop to indicate if the user input is invalid (does not validate according to the elements settings).

```jsx live
<FileInput label="Invalid" invalid message="This input is invalid" />
```
