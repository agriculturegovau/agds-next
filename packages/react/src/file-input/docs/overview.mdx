```jsx live
<FileInput label="Passport" />
```

The File input component is a simple input for selecting and uploading files in a form. It is a wrapper around the native `<input type="file" />` element. Use a File input component when you need to upload one file per form field or when you have multiple form fileds on a page that require one file attachment each. If you need to upload multiple attachments to one form field, use the [File upload](/components/file-upload) component instead.

<DoHeading />

- use if only one file is being uploaded per form field
- use to conserve vertical space
- use when a drag and drop zone isn’t required
- indicate size and type requirements in the hint

<DontHeading />

- use if the user might need to remove the file after uploading
- use if you want the file to be uploaded immediately
- use for uploading multiple files
- use if the user might benefit from a drag and drop zone
- use if it’s the only form element on the page

## Hint

Use the `hint` prop to provide help that’s relevant to the majority of users, like how their information will be used, or where to find it.

Don’t use long paragraphs in hint text. Screen readers read out the entire text when users interact with the form element. This could frustrate users if the text is long.

Don’t include links within hint text. While screen readers will read out the link text when describing the field, they will not tell users that the text is a link.

```jsx live
<FileInput label="Passport" hint="Hint text" />
```

## Required

The `required` prop can be used to indicate that user input is required on the field before a form can be submitted.

Required fields do not append ‘(optional)’ to the label and also use [aria-required](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-required) to indicate to screen readers that the field is required.

## Hide optional label

The `hideOptionalLabel` prop can be used in situations where you want to indicate to screen reader users that a field is optional but don’t want to show the ‘(optional)’ label.

The usage of `hideOptionalLabel` should be reserved for inputs that filter data in a table or chart, and should never be used in standard forms for submitting information.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<FileInput label="Passport" required />
	<FileInput label="Passport" required={false} />
	<FileInput
		label="Passport with hideOptionalLabel"
		required={false}
		hideOptionalLabel={true}
	/>
</Stack>
```

## Invalid

Use the `invalid` prop to indicate if the user input is invalid.

```jsx live
<FileInput label="Passport" invalid message="Passport must be added" required />
```

## Accept

Use the `accept` prop to guide the user toward the accepted file types. This will automatically render a hint, although you can override this by providing your own `hint`.

_NOTE: for security reasons you must validate the file type in your backend and not rely on frontend validation. The `accept` prop does not stop users uploading other file types._

### Accept with default hint

```jsx live
<FileInput accept="image/jpg, image/jpeg, .png" label="Upload image" />
```

### Accept with custom hint

```jsx live
<FileInput
	accept="image/jpg, image/jpeg, image/png"
	hint="Files accepted: .jpg, .jpeg, .png. Max files that can be uploaded is 1."
	label="Upload image"
/>
```

### Accept as array of file extensions

```jsx live
<FileInput accept={['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png']} label="Upload image" />
```

### Accept as array of mime types

Using an array of mime types allows you to leverage TypeScript types and autocomplete. Additionally, you can use glob selectors to provide succinct hints. e.g. here we use `image/*` and the default hint includes “Any image file”.

```jsx live
<FileInput
	accept={['image/*', 'application/pdf']}
	label="Upload image or document"
/>
```

## Selected files

You can display a list of files that have been selected using the `selectedFiles` prop.

It expects an array of objects with a name, size and optional thumbnail url and other properties.

Image files should be displayed with thumbnails which are 144px by 144px. Passing full-size images to `thumbnailSrc` prop will result in unnecessarily longer load times.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [selectedFiles, setSelectedFiles] = React.useState();

	return (
		<FileInput
			label="Passport"
			onChange={(event) => {
				setSelectedFiles(Array.from(event.target.files));
			}}
			selectedFiles={selectedFiles}
		/>
	);
};
```

## Existing files

You can display a list of files that have already been uploaded by using the `existingFiles` prop.

It expects an array of objects with a name, size and optional thumbnail url and other properties.

Image files should be displayed with thumbnails which are 144px by 144px. Passing full-size images to `thumbnailSrc` prop will result in unnecessarily longer load times.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [existingFiles, setExistingFiles] = useState([
		{
			name: 'example.png',
			size: 123456,
			thumbnailSrc: 'https://placehold.co/144',
			href: '#',
			// Use the meta key to keep track of any extra file info
			// This can be useful info when deleting the file
			meta: { uid: 'abc-def', bucketId: '123-456' },
		},
		{
			name: 'example-no-thumbnail.doc',
			size: 654321,
			href: '#',
			// Use the meta key to keep track of any extra file info
			// This can be useful info when deleting the file
			meta: { uid: 'fed-cba', bucketId: '654-321' },
		},
		{
			name: 'example-download-this-page.html',
			size: 999,
			href: '/components/file-upload',
			// Instructs the browser to treat the link as a download
			download: true,
			// Use the meta key to keep track of any extra file info
			// This can be useful info when deleting the file
			meta: { uid: 'zyx-wvu', bucketId: '999-888' },
		},
	]);

	function onRemoveExistingFile(fileToRemove) {
		setExistingFiles((existingFiles) =>
			existingFiles.filter((file) => file.meta.uid !== fileToRemove.meta.uid)
		);
	}

	const [selectedFiles, setSelectedFiles] = React.useState();

	return (
		<FileInput
			label="Passport"
			onChange={(event) => {
				setSelectedFiles(Array.from(event.target.files));
			}}
			multiple
			selectedFiles={selectedFiles}
			existingFiles={existingFiles}
			onRemoveExistingFile={onRemoveExistingFile}
		/>
	);
};
```
