The Box component is a primitive layout component that is heavily used to build other components. It can also be used to create custom layouts and components in your application.

```jsx live showCode
<Box>A simple Box</Box>
```

## The "as" prop

By default, the Box component renders a HTML `<div>` element. You can render it with a different HTML element tag by using the `as` prop.

```jsx live showCode
<Box as="section">A simple Box rendered as a section element</Box>
```

## Styles

Apply styles like padding, border radius, background color and more by using available props. Here's a small example:

```jsx live showCode
<Box background="shade" border padding={1} rounded>
	A Styled Box
</Box>
```

## Responsive props

The Box component supports the responsive prop syntax on most props. For more information about responsive props, see our documentation for [Breakpoints](/foundations/tokens/breakpoints#responsive-design-in-code).
