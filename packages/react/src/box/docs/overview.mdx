The `<Box />` is a primitive layout component that is heavily used to build other components, but can also be used to create custom layouts and components in your application.

```jsx live
<Box>A simple Box</Box>
```

## As

By default, it renders a `<div>`. You can render it with a different HTML element tag by using the as prop:

```jsx live
<Box as="section">A simple Box rendered as a section element</Box>
```

## Styles

Apply styles like padding, margin, border radius, background color and more, by using available props. Here's a small example:

```jsx live
<Box background="shade" border padding={1} rounded>
	A Styled Box
</Box>
```

## Responsive

The `<Box />` component supports the responsive prop syntax on most props. For more information about this, see the [responsive props guides](/guides/responsive-props).
