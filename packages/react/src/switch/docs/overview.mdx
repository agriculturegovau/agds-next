```jsx live
() => {
	const [isChecked, setChecked] = React.useState(false);
	return (
		<Switch
			label="Show establishments"
			checked={isChecked}
			onChange={setChecked}
		/>
	);
};
```

A Switch allows a user to toggle a setting on or off, immediately affecting the user interface. Common use-cases include filtering interfaces and settings menus.

A Switch should not be used in Forms, or where a submit button is needed. Instead, a Checkbox or Radio component should be used.

`Switch` is a [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).

<DoHeading />

- use to toggle settings with immediate effect
- always provide a meaningful label.

<DontHeading />

- use as a Form Input â€“ use a `Checkbox`
- change the colours or icon
- put the label anywhere but on the right of the Switch.

## Size

Control size can be changed using the `size` prop.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [isChecked, setChecked] = React.useState(false);
	return (
		<Switch
			label="Small Switch"
			checked={isChecked}
			onChange={setChecked}
			size="sm"
		/>
	);
};
```
