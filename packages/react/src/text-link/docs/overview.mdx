```jsx live
<Text>
	This is some text with <TextLink href="#">a link</TextLink> inside.
</Text>
```

This package includes the components `<TextLink />` and `<TextLinkExternal />`.

The `TextLink` component creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.

<DoHeading />

- use TextLinkExternal if the link takes the user away from an active flow (such as a form)
- use to link users to other pages
- provide a concise label that describes the target destination – for example, Export Service home.

<DontHeading />

- use TextLinkExternal unless the use case is valid
- use to trigger an action – use a Button instead
- use generic labels such as Click here
- remove styles for action, colour and underline.

## TextLinkExternal

For the most part, always open links in the same browser tab or window. There is generally only one reason to open a page in a new tab/window, which is when the user will need to refer to that content in order to complete a task in another window.

In those situations, the `TextLinkExternal` component can be used to create a link that opens in a new tab and includes descriptive text to communicate the interaction to a screen reader user.

</Text>
```
