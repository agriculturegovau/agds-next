As the user enters text into the field, autocomplete offers suggestions, highlighting the one that best matches the text that has been entered. The list closes when an option is selected.

All TimeSelect components are [controlled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) which means consumers of these components need to manage the state of these components by using the `value` and `onChange` props.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);
	return (
		<TimeSelect
			label="Select time"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
			min="14:00"
			max="19:00"
			step={15}
		/>
	);
};
```

<DoHeading />

- use to help users select from a large list
- provide concise options
- create hint text to let the user know they can search or select
- use a pre-filled list so users can search or scroll
- consider whether the list of selections is complex enough to merit searching and filtering
- indicate whether input is optional.

<DontHeading />

- use if the list of possible results is small – use [Select](/components/select) instead
- leave the list open once an option is selected.

## TimeSelect

Use the `TimeSelect` component when users can choose a single item from a predefined list of options.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);
	return (
		<TimeSelect
			label="Select time"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
		/>
	);
};
```

## TimeSelectAsync

Use the `TimeSelectAsync` component when users can choose a single item from a list of options that needs to be fetched over the network.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);
	return (
		<TimeSelect
			label="Select time"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
			loading
		/>
	);
};
```

## Block

Use the `block` prop to expand the component to fill the available space.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);
	return (
		<TimeSelect
			label="Select time"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			block
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
		/>
	);
};
```

## Required

The `required` prop can be used to indicate that user input is required on the field before a form can be submitted.

Required fields do not append ‘(optional)’ to the label and also use [aria-required](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-required) to indicate to screen readers that the field is required.

### Hide optional label

The `hideOptionalLabel` prop can be used in situations where you want to indicate to screen reader users that a field is optional but don’t want to show the ‘(optional)’ label.

The usage of `hideOptionalLabel` should be reserved for inputs that filter data in a table or chart, and should never be used in standard forms for submitting information.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);
	return (
		<TimeSelect
			label="Select time"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			hideOptionalLabel
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
		/>
	);
};
```

## Invalid

Use the `invalid` prop to indicate if the user input is invalid.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);
	const invalid = !value;
	return (
		<TimeSelect
			label="Select time"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			invalid={invalid}
			message={invalid ? 'Country is required' : undefined}
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
		/>
	);
};
```

## Disabled

Disabled input elements are unusable and can not be clicked. This prevents a user from interacting with the input element until another action is complete.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);
	return (
		<TimeSelect
			label="Select time"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			disabled
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
		/>
	);
};
```

## Clearable

Use the `clearable` prop to render a clear ("x") button when there is a selected option.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);
	return (
		<TimeSelect
			label="Select time"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
			clearable
		/>
	);
};
```
