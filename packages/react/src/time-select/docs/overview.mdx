As the user enters text into the field, autocomplete offers suggestions, highlighting the one that best matches the text that has been entered. The list closes when an option is selected.

All Combobox components are [controlled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) which means consumers of these components need to manage the state of these components by using the `value` and `onChange` props.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);
	return (
		<TimeSelect
			label="Select time"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
			options={TIME_OPTIONS}
			min="14:00"
			max="19:00"
			step={15}
		/>
	);
};
```
