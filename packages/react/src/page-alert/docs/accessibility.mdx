To improve accessibility, you may consider using the ARIA alert role ( role="alert" ) in certain situations.

Using role="alert" will immediately interrupt assistive technology to inform users of the alert and for this reason should be used sparingly.

We recommend only using the role="alert" when there is important time-sensitive information that would be detrimental for a user to miss.

```jsx live
<PageAlert tone="success" title="Submission successful" role="alert">
	<Text as="p">Your application has been successfully submitted.</Text>
</PageAlert>
```
