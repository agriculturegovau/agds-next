Page alerts warn, inform or prompt a user and are generally triggered in response to actions such as save, delete, confirm, submit and cancel.

## Keep it short

Content should be easily understood at a glance.

Use constructive, no-blame language, avoid vague descriptions and always provide a solution.

<ExampleContent heading={<DoHeading />}>
	<PageAlert tone="error" title="We can't find an account with those details">
		<Text as="p">Please check your information and try again</Text>
	</PageAlert>
</ExampleContent>

<ExampleContent heading={<DontHeading />}>
	<PageAlert tone="error" title="You have entered the wrong information">
		<Text as="p">Please come back later</Text>
	</PageAlert>
</ExampleContent>

## Don't repeat yourself

Avoid duplicating the title in the body copy. If the alert title is enough to conveys the message, body copy may not be necessary.

```jsx live
<PageAlert tone="warning" title="Browser out of date">
	<Text as="p">Your web browser out of date</Text>
</PageAlert>
```

## Effective buttons

Always include a Primary and Secondary button CTA that provides a clear path.
Buttons should be clearly labelled with 1-2 verbs such as

- View

- Cancel

- Go back

- Submit

Only use Ok for blue information alerts that require no action, and donâ€™t use ambiguous words such as Yes, or No.

## Validation in forms

Page alert can be used to display validation errors in forms, if there is more that one error. The Page alert contains a bullet list of links as TOC to all the errors below. Focus is set on the page alert as it appears.

If there is a single error in a form, we dont apply the page alert but rather just the standard field-level error, and focus on the input.
