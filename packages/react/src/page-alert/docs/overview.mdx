Typically page alerts appear at the top of a page following a submit action.

<DoHeading />

- place the Page alert component near the top of the page, under the H1 and introductory paragraph, when validating forms and focus immediately after a submission attempt
- use constructive, no-blame language, avoid vague descriptions and always provide a solution
- keep it short – content should be understood at a glance
- use the correct colour tone for the message (see [tones](#tones) below)

<DontHeading />

- insert a Page alert into a [Hero category banner](/components/hero-banner#hero-category-banner), instead position the page alert after the h1
- repeat the title in the description
- if the alert title is enough to convey the message, a description may not be necessary
- use for common actions such as deleting an email or tasks where an action can be undone
- use for information unrelated to the specific journey
- use in a form with only one input error - assign focus to the input where the error occurred
- include a close button for error messages.

## Tones

Choosing a tone for a PageAlert allows the user to understand the importance and severity of the message at a glance.

The four supported tones are `info`, `success`, `error` and `warning`.

### Info

The information page alert (blue) is used to highlight important information to the user before they move on. Info alerts should be used sparingly.

```jsx live
<PageAlert tone="info" title="Notice">
	<Text as="p">
		All vacancies close on the advertised closing date unless otherwise
		specified.
	</Text>
</PageAlert>
```

### Success

The success page alert (green) is used for notifying the user that a task is fully completed.

```jsx live
<PageAlert tone="success" title="Submission successful">
	<Text as="p">Your application has been successfully submitted.</Text>
</PageAlert>
```

### Error

The error page alert (red) should be used with form validation errors or other errors which the user must action before they can can continue.

```jsx live
<PageAlert tone="error" title="There is a problem">
	<Text as="p">Please correct the following fields and try again</Text>
	<UnorderedList>
		<ListItem>
			<TextLink href="#">Full name must not be empty</TextLink>
		</ListItem>
		<ListItem>
			<TextLink href="#">Email must not be empty</TextLink>
		</ListItem>
	</UnorderedList>
</PageAlert>
```

### Warning

Use warning page alerts (orange) to tell the user how to avoid a problem. Only use an alert if the information will help the user avoid a problem.

```jsx live
<PageAlert tone="warning" title="Browser out of date">
	<Text as="p">Your web browser is out of date.</Text>
</PageAlert>
```

## Title

By default, `PageAlert` renders `PageAlertTitle` as an `h3`. If you need to change the title’s semantic tag to an `h2`, for instance, you can use the `PageAlertTitle` component in the `title` prop to explicitly set it.

```jsx
import { PageAlertTitle } from '@ag.ds-next/react/page-alert';

<PageAlert
	tone="success"
	title={<PageAlertTitle as="h2">Submission successful</PageAlertTitle>}
>
	<Text as="p">Your application has been successfully submitted.</Text>
</PageAlert>;
```

## Dismissable

Page alerts can be dismissed by a user if they have understood the message and no longer need to see it.

Use the `onClose` prop to make the alert dismissable. Ensure Page alerts that are closed by the user are never seen again. You could do this through a feature flag in a database, or by setting a value in the browser.

```jsx live
<PageAlert tone="info" title="New update" onClose={console.log}>
	<Text as="p">
		A new feature has been added to the service.{' '}
		<TextLink href="#">Learn more</TextLink>.
	</Text>
</PageAlert>
```
