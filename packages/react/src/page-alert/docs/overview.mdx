Typically page alerts appear at the top of a page following a submit action.

<DoHeading />

- place the Page alert component at the top of the page, under the breadcrumb or back button and above the h1, when validating forms and focus immediately after a submission attempt
- use constructive, no-blame language, avoid vague descriptions and always provide a solution
- keep it short – content should be understood at a glance
- use red error alerts for errors that must be actioned before the user can continue
- use orange warning alerts to tell the user how to avoid a problem
- use green success alerts to confirm a task is completed
- use blue information alerts to highlight important information to the user before they move on.

<DontHeading />

- insert a Page alert into a [Hero category banner](/components/hero-banner#hero-category-banner), instead position the page alert after the h1
- repeat the title in the description
- if the alert title is enough to convey the message a description may not be necessary
- use for common actions such as deleting an email or tasks where an action can be undone
- include a close button for error messages.

## Tones

Choosing a tone for a PageAlert allows the user to understand the importance and severity of the message at a glance.

The four supported tones are `info`, `success`, `error` and `warning`.

### Info

The information page alert is used to highlight important information to the user. Info alerts should be used sparingly.

```jsx live
<PageAlert tone="info" title="Notice">
	<Text as="p">
		All vacancies close on the advertised closing date unless otherwise
		specified.
	</Text>
</PageAlert>
```

### Success

The success page alert is used for notifying the user that a task is fully completed.

```jsx live
<PageAlert tone="success" title="Submission successful">
	<Text as="p">Your application has been successfully submitted.</Text>
</PageAlert>
```

### Error

The error page alert should be used with form validation errors or other errors which the user must action before they can can continue.

```jsx live
<PageAlert tone="error" title="There is a problem">
	<Text as="p">Please correct the following fields and try again</Text>
	<UnorderedList>
		<ListItem>
			<TextLink href="#">Full name must not be empty</TextLink>
		</ListItem>
		<ListItem>
			<TextLink href="#">Email must not be empty</TextLink>
		</ListItem>
	</UnorderedList>
</PageAlert>
```

### Warning

Use warning page alerts to tell the user something urgent. Only use an alert if the information will help the user avoid a problem.

```jsx live
<PageAlert tone="warning" title="Browser out of date">
	<Text as="p">Your web browser is out of date.</Text>
</PageAlert>
```

## Title

You can use the `PageAlertTitle` component in the title prop to change the element used for the title.

```jsx live
<PageAlert
	tone="success"
	title={<PageAlertTitle as="h2">Submission successful</PageAlertTitle>}
>
	<Text as="p">Your application has been successfully submitted.</Text>
</PageAlert>
```

## Dismissable

Page alerts can be dismissed by a user if they have understood the message and no longer need to see it.

Use the `onDismiss` prop to make the alert dismissable. Ensure Page alerts that are closed by the user are never seen again. You could do this through a feature flag in a database, or by setting a value in the browser.

```jsx live
<PageAlert tone="info" title="New update" onDismiss={console.log}>
	<Text as="p">
		A new feature has been added to the service.{' '}
		<TextLink href="#">Learn more</TextLink>.
	</Text>
</PageAlert>
```
