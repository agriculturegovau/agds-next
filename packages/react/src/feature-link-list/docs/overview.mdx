```jsx live
<FeatureLinkList
	links={[
		{
			label: 'Add a business with RAM',
			description:
				'Set up a business to act on behalf of it or invite others to. You can do this if you are responsible for this business in Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM).',
			href: '#',
		},
		{
			label: 'Accept an invite',
			description:
				'Use an invite code from an email to act on behalf of a business.',
			href: '#',
		},
	]}
/>
```

<DoHeading />

- use to emphasise important links to other pages and sites
- use to list a group of links
- avoid opening links in new tabs.

<DontHeading />

- unnecessarily repeat the label in the description
- confuse with Inpage nav, which links to content on the current page
- use outside of the Main region. Link list may be more suitable in this instance.

## No description

Links can also be used without a description should additional information provide little value or negatively increase cognitive load.

```jsx live
<FeatureLinkList
	links={[
		{
			label: 'Add a business with RAM',
			href: '#',
		},
		{
			label: 'Accept an invite',
			href: '#',
		},
	]}
/>
```
