Feature link list provides emphasis and hierarchy to an important list of links. It provides support for description content that will help a user read, understand, assess and select the appropriate link. To enhance usability, a feature link list should always be accompanied by a clear heading.

```jsx live
<FeatureLinkList
	links={[
		{
			label: 'Add a business with RAM',
			description:
				'Set up a business to act on behalf of it or invite others to. You can do this if you are responsible for this business in Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM).',
			href: '#',
		},
		{
			label: 'Accept an invite',
			description:
				'Use an invite code from an email to act on behalf of a business.',
			href: '#',
		},
		{
			label: 'About the department',
			description: 'A suitable description for an external link.',
			href: 'https://www.agriculture.gov.au/',
			target: '_blank',
		},
	]}
/>
```

<DoHeading />

- use to provide emphasis and hierarchy to link lists
- avoid opening links in new tabs; provide an external link icon when it is not possible to open the link in the same browser tab
- aim for consistent use of descriptions for all links in a list.

<DontHeading />

- unnecessarily repeat the label in the description
- include more than 3 lines of copy in the description
- confuse with [Inpage nav](/components/inpage-nav), which links to content on the current page
- use outside of the Main region. Link list may be more suitable in this instance.

## Using without a description

Links can also be used without a description, if the label alone provides enough information.

```jsx live
<FeatureLinkList
	links={[
		{
			label: 'Add a business with RAM',
			href: '#',
		},
		{
			label: 'Accept an invite',
			href: '#',
		},
		{
			label: 'About the department',
			href: 'https://www.agriculture.gov.au/',
			target: '_blank',
		},
	]}
/>
```

## Colour

```jsx live colorSection shadeAlt
<Stack gap={1.5} padding={1.5}>
	<H4>Feature link list: on [%_PALETTE_%] body background</H4>
	<FeatureLinkList
		links={[
			{
				href: '#',
				label: 'Add a business with RAM',
			},
			{
				href: '#',
				label: 'Accept an invite',
			},
			{
				href: '#',
				label: 'About the department',
			},
		]}
	/>
</Stack>
	<Stack background="bodyAlt" gap={1.5} padding={1.5}>
	<H4>Feature link list: on [%_PALETTE_%] bodyAlt background</H4>
	<FeatureLinkList
		background="bodyAlt"
		links={[
			{
				href: '#',
				label: 'Add a business with RAM',
				},
			{
				href: '#',
				label: 'Accept an invite',
			},
			{
				href: '#',
				label: 'About the department',
			},
		]}
	/>
</Stack>
```
