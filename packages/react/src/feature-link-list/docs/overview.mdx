```jsx live
<FeatureLinkList
	links={[
		{
			label: 'Add a business with RAM',
			description:
				'Set up a business to act on behalf of it or invite others to. You can do this if you are responsible for this business in Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM).',
			href: '#',
		},
		{
			label: 'Accept an invite',
			description:
				'Use an invite code from an email to act on behalf of a business.',
			href: '#',
		},
	]}
/>
```

The default feature link list component removes the normal bullets and spacing associated with a list.

<DoHeading />

- use to navigate to other pages
- avoid opening links in new tabs
- use to list a group of links.

<DontHeading />

- confuse with Inpage nav, which links to content on the current page.
