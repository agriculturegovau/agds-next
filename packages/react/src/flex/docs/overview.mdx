The Flex component is a version of [Box](/components/box) which applies `display: flex`.

```jsx live
<Flex>A simple Flex</Flex>
```

## As prop

By default, the Flex component renders a HTML `<div>` element. You can render it with a different HTML element tag by using the `as` prop.

```jsx live
<Flex as="section">A simple Flex rendered as a section element</Flex>
```

## Inline

Use the `inline` prop to apply `display: inline-flex` to the element.

```jsx live
<Flex inline>A simple inline Flex</Flex>
```

## Wrapping

`flexWrap` is an optional prop that makes the children wrap if they can't fit within the container.

```jsx live
<Flex flexWrap>A simple Flex with flex wrapping</Flex>
```

## Box props

Flex supports all of the `BoxProps` from the box component (except for display), with the addition of `inline`. For more information, see [Box props](/components/box/code).

## Responsive props

The Flex component supports the responsive prop syntax on most props. For more information about responsive props, see the [responsive props guide](/guides/responsive-props).
