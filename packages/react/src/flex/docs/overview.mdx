The `<Flex />` component is a version of `<Box />` that applies `display: flex`.

```jsx live
<Flex>A simple Flex</Flex>
```

## As

By default, the Flex component renders a HTML `<div>` element. You can render it with a different HTML element by using the `as` prop:

```jsx live
<Flex as="section">A simple Flex rendered as a section element</Flex>
```

## Inline

Use the `inline` prop to apply `display: inline-flex` to the element.

```jsx live
<Flex inline>A simple inline Flex</Flex>
```

## Wrapping

`flexWrap` is an optional prop that makes the children wrap if they can't fit within the container.

```jsx live
<Flex flexWrap>A simple Flex with flex wrapping</Flex>
```

## Box props

`<Flex />` supports all of the `BoxProps` from the box component (except for display), with the addition of `inline`.

See [Box props](/components/box/code) for more information.

## Responsive

The `<Flex />` component supports the responsive prop syntax on most props.

For more information about this, see the [responsive props guides](/guides/responsive-props).
