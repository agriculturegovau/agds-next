For general guidance on content, go to the [content patterns](/content/content-patterns).

## Length

### Label

Up to 30 characters.

## Structure

### Label

Start with a verb and end with a noun where there is space. Don’t use, conjunctions, prepositions and pronouns in between. Don't wrap labels with quotation marks.

For example, ‘Edit Establishment’, not ‘Edit my Establishment’ or ‘View corrective action’, not ‘View’. If space is limited, use a verb then only.

## Language

### Label

Use a concise, unique and meaningful text label. The label text should describe the specific action that happens next if the user selects it.

Try to avoid using general labels that don't provide the full context. For example, ‘Read more’.
