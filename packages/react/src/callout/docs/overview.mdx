	<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
</Callout>
```

Use callout to notify and alert users of important snippets of information.

<DoHeading />

- use sparingly as they are intrusive - use to help users quickly scan
  to find essential information in a long text page
- use to reiterate important content
- use for quotes in long-form content
- use for additional content formats not included in the main text such as support and contact details, checklists, definitions and
  Did you know? content.

<DontHeading />

- embed in forms
- make the focus of content, they are a supporting tool
- use for errors and alerts – use a Page alert instead
- use for primary content as it may be missed
- mix colour palettes.

## Callout heading screen reader only

A callout with a heading that can be read by screen readers. Markup for the title is included for screen reader users.

```jsx live
<Callout>
	<VisuallyHidden>
		<h2>Title of the callout</h2>
	</VisuallyHidden>
	<Text as="p">Description of the callout</Text>
</Callout>
```

## Calendar

Use a calendar callout to notify and alert users of important dates and events.

```jsx live
<Callout as="section">
	<Flex flexDirection="column">
		<VisuallyHidden>
			<h2>Description of the callout</h2>
		</VisuallyHidden>
		<Text as="p">The next public holiday is:</Text>
		<Text
			as="time"
			fontSize="xl"
			fontWeight="bold"
			dateTime="2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"
		>
			Sunday 1 January
		</Text>
		<Text>New Year’s Day</Text>
	</Flex>
</Callout>
```

## Backgrounds

The background of the `Callout` must pair with the background it is being placed on. For example, if `Callout` is placed on a 'bodyAlt' background, please set the `background` prop to `shadeAlt`.

```jsx live
<Stack background="bodyAlt" padding={3} gap={1}>
	<Text>An area with `bodyAlt` background</Text>
	<Callout title="Callout heading" background="shadeAlt">
		<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
	</Callout>
</Stack>
```
