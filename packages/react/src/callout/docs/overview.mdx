```jsx live
<Callout title="Callout heading">
	<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
</Callout>
```

Use callout to notify and alert users of important snippets of information.

<DoHeading />

- use sparingly as they are intrusive
- use to help users quickly scan to find essential information in a long text page
- use to reiterate important content
- use for quotes in long-form content
- use for additional content formats not included in the main text such as support and contact details, checklists, definitions and
  Did you know? content.

<DontHeading />

- embed form inputs in Callouts
- make the focus of content, they are a supporting tool
- use for errors and alerts â€“ use a Page alert instead
- use for primary content as it may be missed
- use more than 1 per page
- mix colour palettes.

## Tones

Callouts can be used to convey different tones of information. The tone of a callout is conveyed through the background colour and icon.

### Neutral Callout

The normal tone of a callout is `neutral`.

```jsx live
<Callout title="Callout heading">
	<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
</Callout>
```

By default, neutral Callouts make use of the `shade` [background token](/foundations/tokens/colour#background-colours), which must be paired with the normal `body` background.

If a neutral Callout is placed on an area with a `bodyAlt` background, you must set the `tone` prop to `neutralAlt` to ensure the Callout uses the correct `shadeAlt` background. This is to ensure correct contrast and a consistent visual style.

```jsx live
<Stack background="bodyAlt" padding={2} gap={1}>
	<Text>An area with `bodyAlt` background</Text>
	<Callout title="Callout heading" tone="neutralAlt">
		<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
	</Callout>
</Stack>
```

### Information Callout

Use an information callout to notify and alert users of important information.

```jsx live
<Callout title="Callout heading" tone="info">
	<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
</Callout>
```
