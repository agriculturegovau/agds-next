```jsx live
<Callout title="Callout heading">
	<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
</Callout>
```

Use callout to draw a user’s attention to important snippets of static information.

<DoHeading />

- use sparingly as they are intrusive
- use to help users quickly scan to find essential information in a long text page
- use to reiterate important content
- use for quotes in long-form content
- use different tones and variants on the same page to convey information hierarchy
- use to format content not included in the main text such as support and contact details, checklists, definitions and ‘Did you know?’ content.

<DontHeading />

- embed form inputs in Callouts
- use in conditionally revealed checkbox or radio groups
- make them the focus of content; they are a supporting tool
- use for errors and alerts – use a Page alert or Section alert instead
- use for primary content, as it may be missed
- mix colour palettes.

## Tones

Callouts can be used to convey different tones of information. The tone of a callout is conveyed through the background colour and icon.

### Neutral Callout

The default tone of a callout is `neutral`.

```jsx live
<Callout title="Callout heading">
	<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
</Callout>
```

By default, neutral Callouts make use of the `shade` [background token](/foundations/tokens/colour#background-colours), which must be paired with the normal `body` background.

If the neutral Callout component is placed on a page with `bodyAlt` background, set the `onBodyAlt` prop to `true`. This ensures the correct shade background token is used by the component.

```jsx live
<Stack background="bodyAlt" padding={2} gap={1}>
	<Text>An area with `bodyAlt` background</Text>
	<Callout title="Callout heading" tone="neutral" onBodyAlt>
		<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
	</Callout>
</Stack>
```

### Information Callout

Use an `info` tone to highlight information which is important for users.

```jsx live
<Callout title="Callout heading" tone="info">
	<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
</Callout>
```

## Compact

Compact version of the callout can be used when there is limited space, such as inside of an Accordion.

```jsx live
<Accordion>
	<AccordionItem title="Accordion 1">
		<AccordionItemContent>
			<Text as="p">Here is the accordion content.</Text>
		</AccordionItemContent>
	</AccordionItem>
	<AccordionItem isInitiallyOpen title="Accordion 2">
		<AccordionItemContent>
			<Stack gap="1">
				<Text as="p">
					Here is the conditionally revealed content with callout.
				</Text>
				<TextLink href="#">Light link</TextLink>
				<Callout title="Callout heading" tone="info" variant="compact">
					<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
				</Callout>
			</Stack>
		</AccordionItemContent>
	</AccordionItem>
	<AccordionItem title="Accordion 3">
		<AccordionItemContent>
			<Text as="p">Here is the accordion content.</Text>
		</AccordionItemContent>
	</AccordionItem>
	<AccordionItem title="Accordion 4">
		<AccordionItemContent>
			<Text as="p">Here is the accordion content.</Text>
		</AccordionItemContent>
	</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

## Feature

The feature variant of the callout can be used to draw even more emphasis to the content.

```jsx live
<Callout title="Feature Callout heading" tone="info" variant="feature">
	<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
</Callout>
```

## Colour

AgDS foreground components respond to the background colour of their parent container. When placed on a dark palette background, the dark palette variant of the component is displayed. When placed on a light palette background the light palette variant is displayed.

This logic ensures sufficient contrast between foreground and background elements is maintained to meet WCAG 2.1AA, 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text (WCAG 1.4.3) and 3:1 for graphic elements that convey information (WCAG 1.4.11).

```jsx live
<Fragment>
	<Stack as="ul" css={{ listStyle: 'none' }} gap="1" paddingBottom="1">
		<Box as="li">
			<Callout title="Callout light 1">
				<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
			</Callout>
		</Box>
		<Box as="li">
			<Callout title="Callout light 2" tone="info">
				<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
			</Callout>
		</Box>
	</Stack>

	<Stack as="ul" css={{ listStyle: 'none' }} gap="1" palette="dark">
		<Box as="li">
			<Callout title="Callout dark 1">
				<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
			</Callout>
		</Box>
		<Box as="li">
			<Callout title="Callout dark 2" tone="info">
				<Text as="p">Description of the callout.</Text>
			</Callout>
		</Box>
	</Stack>
</Fragment>
```
