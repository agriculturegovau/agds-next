```jsx live
<Breadcrumbs
	links={[
		{ href: '#', label: 'Home' },
		{ href: '#', label: 'Establishments' },
		{ label: 'Applications' },
	]}
/>
```

Breadcrumbs show users where they are in the website hierarchy and how to navigate back/up to previous levels or content.

<DoHeading />

- Display above the current page title (h1)
- Display the current page title in the breadcrumbs
- Match the breadcrumb to full page title.

<DontHeading />

- Shorten breadcrumb labels
- Use for pages with single-level hierarchy
- Use for multistep processes – use a progress indicator.

## When to use the Breadcrumb component

Breadcrumbs are best applied to content pages and should not be used on form flows as they make it easier for users to navigate away from the form.

A Back button can be used in place of a breadcrumb when you want to keep a user in a flow or to maintain the parent child relationship between two pages. Multi-page forms or side-flows are examples of where to apply back buttons. 

Back buttons should not be used on content pages as they do not show a user where they are in relation to the rest of a site structure. They allow a user to navigate up only one level whereas a breadcrumb allow navigation back through the entire site.

When using Back buttons always use the label ‘Back’ rather than the name of the parent page. The label ‘Back’ is universal, can be understood in any context and does not require the user to remember the name of the parent page.
