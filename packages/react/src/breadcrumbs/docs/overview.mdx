```jsx live
<Breadcrumbs
	links={[
		{ href: '#', label: 'Home' },
		{ href: '#', label: 'Establishments' },
		{ label: 'Applications' },
	]}
/>
```

Breadcrumbs show users where they are in the website hierarchy and how to navigate back/up to previous levels or content.

<DoHeading />

- Display above the current page title (h1)
- Display the current page title in the breadcrumbs
- Match the breadcrumb to full page title.

<DontHeading />

- Shorten breadcrumb labels
- Use for pages with single-level hierarchy
- Use for multistep processes â€“ use a progress indicator.
