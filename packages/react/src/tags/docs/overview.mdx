<DoHeading />

- use when content has multiple categories
- use with or without links
- add to a page to improve SEO
- use links to filter/group data types
- precede them with an appropriate heading.

<DontHeading />

- use as a status indicator – use StatusBadge
- overwrite Tag colours or fills.
- use Tags with links and remove buttons together, as it is confusing for users.

## Tags with links

A list of related tags that use links.

Note: An appropriate heading level should be used to introduce the purpose of the list.

```jsx live
<Tags
	heading={
		<Text as="h2" fontWeight="bold">
			Tags:
		</Text>
	}
	items={[
		{ href: '#', label: 'Apple' },
		{ href: '#', label: 'Orange' },
		{ href: '#', label: 'Peach' },
	]}
/>
```

## Tags without links

A list of related tags without links.

```jsx live
<Tags
	heading={
		<Text as="h2" fontWeight="bold">
			Tags:
		</Text>
	}
	items={[{ label: 'Apple' }, { label: 'Orange' }, { label: 'Peach' }]}
/>
```

## Removable tags

Tags can be removed from a list, if you add an `onRemove` function.

Please avoid using Tags with links and remove buttons together, as it is confusing for users.

When a user removes a tag, their focus is automatically moved to the next tag in the list (where appropriate). However it’s important to manage their focus appropriately to help them continue their task or journey. In some cases, there may not be an obvious (or any) element to send focus to, such as when the alert was triggered by an action on a previous page or from a drawer that is now closed. Always carefully consider the context and previous user actions before moving their focus to ensure a smooth and accessible experience.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [items, setItems] = React.useState([
		{ label: 'Apple' },
		{ label: 'Orange' },
		{ label: 'Peach' },
	]);
	const [announcement, setAnnouncement] = React.useState('');

	const handleRemove = (label) => {
		setItems((prevItems) => prevItems.filter((item) => item.label !== label));
		setAnnouncement(`${label} removed`);
		// document.getElementById(label).focus();
	};

	const itemsWithHandlers = items.map((item) => ({
		...item,
		onRemove: () => handleRemove(item.label),
	}));

	return (
		<>
			<button id="Apple">Apple</button>
			<button id="Orange">Orange</button>
			<button id="Peach">Peach</button>
			<Box zcss={visuallyHiddenStyles} role="status">
				{announcement}
			</Box>
			{items.length > 0 ? (
				<Tags
					heading={
						<Text as="h2" fontWeight="bold">
							Tags:
						</Text>
					}
					items={itemsWithHandlers}
				/>
			) : undefined}
		</>
	);
};
```
