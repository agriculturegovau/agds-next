The field component connects the label, description and message to the input element.

```jsx live
<Field label="Name">{(a11yProps) => <input {...a11yProps} />}</Field>
```

## Label

Each field must be accompanied by a label. Effective form labeling helps users understand what information to enter into the input.

```jsx live
<Field label="Name">{(a11yProps) => <input {...a11yProps} />}</Field>
```

## Hint

Use the `hint` prop to provide help thatâ€™s relevant to the majority of users, like how their information will be used, or where to find it.

Don't use long paragraphs and lists in hint text. Screen readers read out the entire text when users interact with the form element. This could frustrate users if the text is long.

Don't include links within hint text. While screen readers will read out the link text when describing the field, they will not tell users that the text is a link.

```jsx live
<Field label="Email" hint="We will only use this to respond to your question">
	{(a11yProps) => <input type="email" {...a11yProps} />}
</Field>
```

## Invalid

Error messages are used to notify the user when a form field has not passed validation. Use clear messages to explain what went wrong and how to fix it.

```jsx live
<Field
	label="Email"
	invalid
	message="Enter an email address in the correct format, like name@example.com"
>
	{(a11yProps) => <input type="email" {...a11yProps} />}
</Field>
```

## Required

The `required` prop can be used to indicate that user input is required on the field before a form can be submitted.

Using the `required` prop, this component will automatically append "(optional)" to the label as well as using [aria-required](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-required) to indicate to screen reader user that the field is required.

### Hide optional label

The `hideOptionalLabel` prop can be used in situations where you want to indiciate to screen reader users that a field is optional but don't want to show the "(optional)" label.

The usage of `hideOptionalLabel` should be reserved for inputs that filter data in a table or chart, and should never be used in standard forms for submitting information.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<Field label="Required" required={true}>
		{(a11yProps) => <input {...a11yProps} />}
	</Field>
	<Field label="Optional" required={false}>
		{(a11yProps) => <input {...a11yProps} />}
	</Field>
	<Field
		label="Optional with hideOptionalLabel"
		required={false}
		hideOptionalLabel={true}
	>
		{(a11yProps) => <input {...a11yProps} />}
	</Field>
</Stack>
```

## Hooks

### useScrollToField

`useScrollToField` is a hook that can be used to scroll and focus users to a form field on the same page.

Because our labels or legends appear above the input, when using native browsers API's users will be presented with an input without any context, as the label or legend will be off the top of the screen. Manually handling the click event, scrolling the question into view and then focussing the element solves this.

Please refer to the [example site single-page form example](/example-site/single-page-form) to see an example of this hook in use.

```jsx
/**
 * Example usage when displaying a list of form validation errors
 */
function ExampleOne() {
	const scrollToField = useScrollToField();
	return (
		<ul>
			{Object.entries(errors).map(([id, errorMessage]) => (
				<li key={id}>
					<a href={`#${id}`} onClick={scrollToField}>
						{errorMessage}
					</a>
				</li>
			))}
		</ul>
	);
}

/**
 * Example usage scrolling and focusing to a specific field on first mount
 */
function ExampleTwo() {
	const targetId = 'last-name'; // This could potentially come from route query params
	const scrollToField = useScrollToField();

	React.useEffect(() => {
		scrollToField(targetId);
	}, [scrollToField]);

	return (
		<FormStack>
			<TextInput label="First name" id="first-name" />
			<TextInput label="Last name" id="last-name" />
		</FormStack>
	);
}
```
