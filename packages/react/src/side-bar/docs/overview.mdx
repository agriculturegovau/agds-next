Side bar is a layout component which frames secondary navigation content. It's collapses on mobile to allow the user to focus on the primary content.

Side bar is used internally by the [SideNav](/components/side-nav) and [ProgressIndicator](/components/progress-indicator) components. You should consider using those components before using Side bar directly.

```jsx live
<SideBar collapseButtonLabel="Collapse button label">
	<SideBarTitle title="Side bar title" />
	<Box paddingY={1}>Side bar Content area</Box>
</SideBar>
```

<DoHeading />

- Use Side bar to contain data filters.
- Use the SideBarTitle component to add a title above the content area.

<DontHeading />

- Compose custom navigation components without considering if [SideNav](/components/side-nav) or [ProgressIndicator](/components/progress-indicator) is right for your usecase.
