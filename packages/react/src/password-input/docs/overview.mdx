```jsx live
<PasswordInput label="Password" />
```

<DoHeading />

- use to allow a user to securely enter a password
- obscure the password by default

<DontHeading />

- use for anything else besides passwords
- display the password by default

## Hint

Use the `hint` prop to provide help thatâ€™s relevant to the majority of users, like how their information will be used, or where to find it.

Don't use long paragraphs and lists in hint text. Screen readers read out the entire text when users interact with the form element. This could frustrate users if the text is long.

Don't include links within hint text. While screen readers will read out the link text when describing the field, they will not tell users that the text is a link.

```jsx live
<PasswordInput label="Password" hint="Hint text" />
```

## Required

The `required` prop can be used to indicate that user input is required on the field before a form can be submitted.

Using the `required` prop, this component will automatically append "(optional)" to the label as well as using [aria-required](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-required) to indicate to screen reader user that the field is required.

### Hide optional label

The `hideOptionalLabel` prop can be used in situations where you want to indiciate to screen reader users that a field is optional but don't want to show the "(optional)" label.

The usage of `hideOptionalLabel` should be reserved for inputs that filter data in a table or chart, and should never be used in standard forms for submitting information.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<PasswordInput label="Required" required />
	<PasswordInput label="Optional" required={false} />
	<PasswordInput
		label="Optional with hideOptionalLabel"
		required={false}
		hideOptionalLabel={true}
	/>
</Stack>
```

## Invalid

Use the `invalid` prop to indicate if the user input is invalid (does not validate according to the elements settings).

```jsx live
<PasswordInput label="Password" invalid message="Enter your password" />
```

## Disabled

Disabled input elements are unusable and can not be clicked. This prevents a user from interacting with the input element until another action is complete. Disabled input elements in a form will not be submitted.

```jsx live
<PasswordInput label="Password" value="abc123" disabled />
```

## Maximum widths

The width of a text input field should indicate the amount of information expected to be entered into the field. The size of the text input acts as a visual constraint for the end user.

As an example, input fields for postcodes should have a smaller width than fields for emails.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<PasswordInput label="md input" maxWidth="md" />
	<PasswordInput label="lg input" maxWidth="lg" />
	<PasswordInput label="xl input" maxWidth="xl" />
</Stack>
```

## Block

Use the `block` prop to expand the component to fill the available space.

```jsx live
<PasswordInput label="Password" block />
```
