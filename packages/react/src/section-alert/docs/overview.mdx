Section alerts appear inside of the main content area of the page and are used to alert users to a particular section of the screen. They should not be confused with Callouts.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="Your changes have been saved" tone="success" />
```

<DoHeading />

- Use to notify users about a change in state in a section of a
  page
- Use to communicate error or success messages
- Allow it to be dismissed if it is not critical.
- place above interactive components or at the top of page sections to show information or status
- use constructive no-blame language, avoid vague descriptions and always provide a solution
- keep it short - content should be understood at a glance
- use the appropriate status of success, info, error or warning

<DontHeading />

- Use to communicate messages which relate to the entire page - use [Page alert](/components/page-alert) instead
- Use to communicate messages which relate to the entire application - use [Global alert](/components/global-alert) instead
- Use to contain text in articles or other blocks of text content - use [Callout](/components/callout) instead
- Hide the message automatically. Let the user dismiss the message instead.
- use for form errors - use page alert instead
- repeat the title in the description
- use the description if the title is enough to convey the message
- include a close button for error messages which block further progress

## Tones

Section alert can be used to communicate different types of messages. Choosing a tone for a Section alert allows the user to understand the importance and severity of the message at a glance.

The three supported tones are success, error and warning.

### Success

The success section alert is used for notifying the user that a task is fully completed.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="Your changes have been saved" tone="success" />
```

### Error

The error section alert should be used when something destructive or critical has happened.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="There was an error saving your changes" tone="error" />
```

### Warning

Use warning section alerts to tell the user something urgent. Only use an alert if the information will help the user avoid a problem.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="A warning message for this section" tone="warning" />
```

## Composition

Section alerts are composed of an icon, heading, description, action and close action.

The icon and heading are mandatory and achieve a compact alert, but we encourage the use of description when more information might be helpful to the user.

Section alerts can be dismissed by a user if they have understood the message and no longer need to see it. Only use the close action when the alert does not impact the userâ€™s available actions.
Avoid dismissing error messages which block the user from completing a task. Instead, provide a way for the user to fix the error, then dismiss the alert once the error has been resolved.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<SectionAlert
		title="Section alert title"
		tone="success"
		onDismiss={console.log}
	/>

	<SectionAlert title="Section alert title" tone="success">
		<Text as="p">Description</Text>
	</SectionAlert>

	<SectionAlert title="Section alert title" tone="warning">
		<Stack gap={0.5} alignItems="flex-start">
			<Text as="p">Description</Text>
			<ButtonGroup>
				<Button variant="text">Action</Button>
				<Button variant="text">Action</Button>
			</ButtonGroup>
		</Stack>
	</SectionAlert>
</Stack>
```
