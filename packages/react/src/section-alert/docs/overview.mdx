Section alerts appear inside of the main content area of the page and are used to alert users to a particular section of the screen. They should not be confused with Callouts.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="Your changes have been saved" tone="success" />
```

<DoHeading />

- use to notify users about a change in state in a section of a
  page
- use to communicate error, warning or success messages
- allow users to dismiss alerts that are not critical
- place above interactive components or at the top of page sections
- use constructive, no-blame language, avoid vague descriptions and always provide a solution
- keep it short - content should be understood at a glance
- use the appropriate status and tone of success, error or warning.

<DontHeading />

- use to communicate messages which relate to the entire page - use [Page alert](/components/page-alert) instead
- use to communicate messages which relate to the entire application - use [Global alert](/components/global-alert) instead
- use to contain text in articles or other blocks of text content - use [Callout](/components/callout) instead
- hide the message automatically. Let the user dismiss the message instead
- repeat the title in the description
- use the description if the title is enough to convey the message
- include a close button for error messages.

## Tones

Section alert can be used to communicate different types of messages. Choosing a tone for a Section alert allows the user to understand the importance and severity of the message at a glance.

The three supported tones are `success`, `error` and `warning`.

### Success

The success section alert (green) is used for notifying the user that a task is fully completed.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="Your changes have been saved" tone="success" />
```

### Error

The error section alert (red) should be used when something destructive or critical has happened.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="There was an error saving your changes" tone="error" />
```

### Warning

Use warning section alerts (orange) to tell the user something urgent. Only use an alert if the information will help the user avoid a problem.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="A warning message for this section" tone="warning" />
```

## Composition

Section alerts are composed of an icon, heading, description, action and close action.

The icon and heading are mandatory and achieve a compact alert, but we encourage the use of description when more information might be helpful to the user.

Section alerts can be dismissed by a user if they have understood the message and no longer need to see it. Only use the close action when the alert does not impact the userâ€™s available actions.
Avoid dismissing error messages which block the user from completing a task. Instead, provide a way for the user to fix the error, then dismiss the alert once the error has been resolved.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<SectionAlert
		title="Section alert title"
		tone="success"
		onClose={console.log}
	/>

	<SectionAlert title="Section alert title" tone="success">
		<Text as="p">Description</Text>
	</SectionAlert>

	<SectionAlert title="Section alert title" tone="warning">
		<Stack gap={0.5} alignItems="flex-start">
			<Text as="p">Description</Text>
			<ButtonGroup>
				<Button variant="text">Action</Button>
				<Button variant="text">Action</Button>
			</ButtonGroup>
		</Stack>
	</SectionAlert>
</Stack>
```

## Focusing the alert

_NOTE: When focusing an alert after closing a `Drawer`, use the [focusElementOnClose prop in the Drawer component](/components/drawer#focus-custom-element-on-close)._

In the event you need to focus the alert, you can do so in one of two ways:

1. [Manually set focus](#manually-set-focus).
2. [Automatically focus on mount](#automatically-focus-on-mount).

### Manually set focus

Press the "Focus the alert" button below to set focus on the alert. To achieve this, we set the `tabIndex` to `-1`. This will allow programmatic focusing and will render a focus ring to aid accessibility.

```jsx live
() => {
	const alertRef = React.useRef(null);

	return (
		<Stack gap={2}>
			<Box alignSelf="start">
				<Button onClick={() => alertRef.current.focus()}>
					Focus the alert
				</Button>
			</Box>

			<SectionAlert
				ref={alertRef}
				tabIndex={-1}
				title="Submission successful"
				tone="success"
			>
				<Text as="p">Your application has been successfully submitted.</Text>
			</SectionAlert>
		</Stack>
	);
};
```

### Automatically focus on mount

Press the "Toggle alert" button below to mount/unmount the alert. Notice that each time the alert is mounted it will be focused. Here we use the `focusOnMount` boolean prop to automatically handle the focusing.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [showAlert, setShowAlert] = React.useState(false);

	return (
		<Stack gap={2}>
			<Box alignSelf="start">
				<Button onClick={() => setShowAlert((prevShowAlert) => !prevShowAlert)}>
					Toggle alert
				</Button>
			</Box>

			{showAlert && (
				<SectionAlert focusOnMount title="Something went wrong" tone="error">
					<Text as="p">There was an error submitting the application.</Text>
				</SectionAlert>
			)}
		</Stack>
	);
};
```
