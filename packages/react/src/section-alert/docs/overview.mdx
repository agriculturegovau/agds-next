Section alerts appear inside of the main content area of the page and are used to alert users to a particular section of the screen. They should not be confused with Callouts.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="Your changes have been saved" tone="successHigh" />
```

<DoHeading />

- use to notify users about a change in state in a section of a page
- use to communicate error, warning, success, informative or progress messages
- allow users to dismiss alerts that are not critical
- place above interactive components or at the top of page sections
- use constructive, no-blame language, avoid vague descriptions and always provide a solution
- keep it short - content should be understood at a glance
- use the appropriate feedback or progress status and tone warning
- apply tee correct emphasis level to communicate the urgency or importance of the status tone.

<DontHeading />

- use to communicate messages which relate to the entire page - use [Page alert](/components/page-alert) instead
- use to communicate messages which relate to the entire application - use [Global alert](/components/global-alert) instead
- change tone colours or apply new colours - the default colour set has semantic meaning that matches the ARIA label and meaningful image
- use to contain text in articles or other blocks of text content - use [Callout](/components/callout) instead
- repeat the title in the description
- use the description if the title is enough to convey the message
- include a close button for error messages
- hide the message automatically. Let the user dismiss the message instead.

## Tones

Section alert can be used to communicate different types of messages. Choosing a tone for a Section alert allows the user to understand the importance and severity of the message at a glance.

The five supported tones are:

- [success](#success)
- [error](#error)
- [warning](#warning)
- [information](#information)
- [in progress](#in-progress)

### Success

The success section alert is used for notifying the user that a task is fully completed.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<SectionAlert title="Your changes have been saved" tone="successHigh" />
</Stack>
```

### Error

The error section alert should be used when something destructive or critical has happened.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<SectionAlert
		title="There was an error saving your changes"
		tone="errorHigh"
	/>
</Stack>
```

### Warning

Use warning section alerts to tell the user something urgent. Only use an alert if the information will help the user avoid a problem.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<SectionAlert title="A warning message for this section" tone="warningHigh" />
</Stack>
```

### Information

Use the info section alerts to highlight information which is important for users.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<SectionAlert
		title="These records contain information you might need"
		tone="infoHigh"
	/>
</Stack>
```

## In progress

Use in progress section alerts to highlight information which is relates to status.

The progress section alert can be used to indicate the users current progress.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<SectionAlert title="Record is in progress" tone="inProgressLow" />
</Stack>
```

## Status and emphasis

The tone prop combines both a status and emphasis, which sets the correct importance and severity of the Section alert by automatically applying appropriate colour, iconography and accessible descriptions.

There are nine unique tones with five levels of emphasis. All tones are available in Low emphasis but others are only available in Medium and High.

### High emphasis

High emphasis Section alerts use filled icons and are available in four tone colours.

Use high emphasis section alerts for:

- important system messages
- notifications that require user action
- conveying urgent status in lists.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<SectionAlert title="Your changes have been saved" tone="successHigh" />
	<SectionAlert
		title="There was an error saving your changes"
		tone="errorHigh"
	/>
	<SectionAlert title="A warning message for this section" tone="warningHigh" />
	<SectionAlert
		title="An information message for this section"
		tone="infoHigh"
	/>
</Stack>
```

### Medium emphasis

Medium emphasis Section alerts use stroked icons and are available in four tone colours.

Use medium emphasis section alerts to:

- convey non-urgent alerts.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<SectionAlert title="Your changes have been saved" tone="successMedium" />
	<SectionAlert
		title="There was an error saving your changes"
		tone="errorMedium"
	/>
	<SectionAlert
		title="A warning message for this section"
		tone="warningMedium"
	/>
	<SectionAlert
		title="An information message for this section"
		tone="infoMedium"
	/>
</Stack>
```

### Low emphasis

Low emphasis Section alerts use stroked icons and are available in the default, neutral colour only.

Use low emphasis section alerts to:

- convey non-urgent alerts
- convey progress through a process.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<SectionAlert title="Success" tone="successLow" />
	<SectionAlert title="Error" tone="errorLow" />
	<SectionAlert title="Warning" tone="warningLow" />
	<SectionAlert title="Info" tone="infoLow" />
	<Divider />
	<SectionAlert title="Cannot start" tone="cannotStartLow" />
	<SectionAlert title="In progress" tone="inProgressLow" />
	<SectionAlert title="Paused" tone="pausedLow" />
	<SectionAlert title="Not started" tone="notStartedLow" />
	<SectionAlert title="Unknown" tone="unknownLow" />
</Stack>
```

## Dismissable

Section alerts can be dismissed by a user if they have understood the message and no longer need to see it. Only use the close action when the alert does not impact the user’s available actions.
Avoid dismissing error messages which block the user from completing a task. Instead, provide a way for the user to fix the error, then dismiss the alert once the error has been resolved.

Use the `onClose` prop to make the alert dismissable.

When a user dismisses an alert, it’s important to manage their focus appropriately to help them continue their task or journey. In some cases, there may not be an obvious (or any) element to send focus to, such as when the alert was triggered by an action on a previous page or from a drawer that is now closed. Always carefully consider the context and previous user actions before moving their focus to ensure a smooth and accessible experience.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert
	onClose={console.log}
	title="Section alert title"
	tone="successHigh"
/>
```
