Section alerts appear inside of the main content area of the page and are used to alert users to a particular section of the screen. They should not be confused with Callouts.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="Your changes have been saved" tone="success" />
```

<DoHeading />

- use to notify users about a change in state in a section of a
  page
- use to communicate error, warning or success messages
- allow users to dismiss alerts that are not critical
- place above interactive components or at the top of page sections
- use constructive, no-blame language, avoid vague descriptions and always provide a solution
- keep it short - content should be understood at a glance
- use the appropriate status and tone of success, error or warning.

<DontHeading />

- use to communicate messages which relate to the entire page - use [Page alert](/components/page-alert) instead
- use to communicate messages which relate to the entire application - use [Global alert](/components/global-alert) instead
- use to contain text in articles or other blocks of text content - use [Callout](/components/callout) instead
- hide the message automatically. Let the user dismiss the message instead
- repeat the title in the description
- use the description if the title is enough to convey the message
- include a close button for error messages.

## Tones

Section alert can be used to communicate different types of messages. Choosing a tone for a Section alert allows the user to understand the importance and severity of the message at a glance.

The three supported tones are `success`, `error` and `warning`.

### Success

The success section alert (green) is used for notifying the user that a task is fully completed.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="Your changes have been saved" tone="success" />
```

### Error

The error section alert (red) should be used when something destructive or critical has happened.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="There was an error saving your changes" tone="error" />
```

### Warning

Use warning section alerts (orange) to tell the user something urgent. Only use an alert if the information will help the user avoid a problem.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="A warning message for this section" tone="warning" />
```

## Composition

Section alerts are composed of an icon, heading, description, action and close action.

The icon and heading are mandatory and achieve a compact alert, but we encourage the use of description when more information might be helpful to the user.

Section alerts can be dismissed by a user if they have understood the message and no longer need to see it. Only use the close action when the alert does not impact the user’s available actions.
Avoid dismissing error messages which block the user from completing a task. Instead, provide a way for the user to fix the error, then dismiss the alert once the error has been resolved.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<SectionAlert
		title="Section alert title"
		tone="success"
		onClose={console.log}
	/>

	<SectionAlert title="Section alert title" tone="success">
		<Text as="p">Description</Text>
	</SectionAlert>

	<SectionAlert title="Section alert title" tone="warning">
		<Stack gap={0.5} alignItems="flex-start">
			<Text as="p">Description</Text>
			<ButtonGroup>
				<Button variant="text">Action</Button>
				<Button variant="text">Action</Button>
			</ButtonGroup>
		</Stack>
	</SectionAlert>
</Stack>
```
