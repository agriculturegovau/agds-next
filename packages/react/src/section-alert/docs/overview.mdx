Section alert are used in regions or sections of a page to notify users about a change in state - such saving changes or a widget throwing an error.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="Your changes have been saved" tone="success" />
```

<DoHeading />

- Use to notify users about a change in state in a section of a
  page
- Use to communicate error or success messages
- Allow it to be dismissed if it is not critical.

<DontHeading />

- Use to communicate messages which relate to the entire page - use [Page alert](/components/page-alert) instead
- Use to communicate messages which relate to the entire application - use [Global alert](/components/global-alert) instead
- Use to contain text in articles or other blocks of text content - use [Callout](/components/callout) instead
- Hide the message automatically. Let the user dismiss the message instead.

## Tones

Section alert can be used to communicate different types of messages. Choosing a tone for a Section alert allows the user to understand the importance and severity of the message at a glance.

The four supported tones are info, success, error and warning.

### Success

Use to communicate a successful action.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="Your changes have been saved" tone="success" />
```

### Error

Use to communicate an error, such as a failed action within a widget.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="There was an error saving your changes" tone="error" />
```

### Warning

Use warning page alerts to tell the user something urgent. Only use an alert if the information will help the user avoid a problem.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="A warning message for this section" tone="warning" />
```

### Info

The information page alert is used to highlight important information to the user. Consider if a [Callout](/components/callout) would be more appropriate for your use case.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="Important information for this section" tone="info" />
```

## Description

The description prop can be used to provide more information about the alert. This is useful for providing more context to the user.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert title="Your changes have been saved" tone="success">
	<Text as="p">Your application has been successfully submitted.</Text>
</SectionAlert>
```

## Dismissable

Section alerts can be dismissed by a user if they have understood the message and no longer need to see it. Use the onDismiss prop to make the alert dismissable.

Avoid dismissing error messages which block the user from completing a task. Instead, provide a way for the user to fix the error, then dismiss the alert once the error has been resolved.

```jsx live
<SectionAlert
	title="Your changes have been saved"
	tone="success"
	onDismiss={console.log}
/>
```
