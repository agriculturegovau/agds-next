## Language

Use plain language.

Avoid punctuation such as full stops, commas, or semicolons.

Write in Sentence case.

Avoid articles such as the, an, or a in titles and button copy.

## Voice and tone

Go to the [TFTM Voice and tone guide](/content/voice-and-tone) for guidance.

## Composition

Section alerts are composed of an icon, title, description, action and close action.

The icon and title are mandatory and achieve a compact alert, but we encourage the use of description when additional information might be helpful to the user.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<SectionAlert
		onClose={console.log}
		title="Section alert title"
		tone="successHigh"
	/>

	<SectionAlert title="Section alert title" tone="successHigh">
		<Text as="p">Description</Text>
	</SectionAlert>

	<SectionAlert title="Section alert title" tone="warningHigh">
		<Stack gap={0.5} alignItems="flex-start">
			<Text as="p">Description</Text>
			<ButtonGroup>
				<Button variant="text">Action 1</Button>
				<Button variant="text">Action 2</Button>
			</ButtonGroup>
		</Stack>
	</SectionAlert>
</Stack>
```
