## Overview

The app layout is a single component that consists of 3 parts. All 3 parts should be used together across all pages of a web application.

1. [App layout header](#app-layout-header)
2. [App layout sidebar](#app-layout-sidebar)
3. [App layout footer](#app-layout-footer)

Use the app layout for web applications, not informational websites, as the layout is better suited to task-oriented interactions.

## Usage guidelines

<DoHeading />

- use the app layout for web applications i.e. task oriented websites that users generally need to sign in to access.
- use the app layout consistently on all pages of an application
- display the app layout sidebar by default on general app pages
- hide the app layout sidebar for forms to support user focus
- use all parts of the app layout always

<DontHeading />

- use the app layout for informational websites, use the informational website templates instead: [home page](/templates/home), [category page](/templates/category), [subcategory page](/templates/subcategory), and [content page](/templates/content)
- use some parts of this component and not others, they should always be used together.

## App layout header

The app layout header tells users what application they’re using and displays the logo.

- **Heading and subline** - The heading should be set to the website or service title and the subline can be used to provide additional information to describe your website or service.

- **Account details** - A user’s name and avatar or entity information should be displayed in the top right corner to clearly show which account they’re signed in to. Users can access their account settings via the dropdown.

## App layout sidebar

The app layout sidebar houses the main navigational menu which provides users with a consistent way to navigate around a web application.

Each menu item can have an optional icon on the left to help users scan the menu faster. Menu items can also have a [Notification badge](/components/notification-badge) on the right to indicate the number of notifications.

The app layout sidebar should be hidden while users are completing multi-page forms. This is known as [focus mode](/patterns/focus-mode) and is intended to reduce distractions and cognitive load.

### Sub-level items

To help users comprehend the side navigation, choose a strategy that is appropriate for the number of items in the list.

#### Visible when active

When the list of items is long, prefer showing any sub-level lists when either navigating to the parent item or one of the sub-level items. Since this is the default behaviour, either setting `subLevelVisible="whenActive"` or omitting this prop will use this strategy.

#### Always visible

When you have a small number of sub-level items, it’s easier for users to see all items at once. Set `subLevelVisible="always"` to achieve this.

## App layout footer

The footer lives at the bottom of a page and generally contains copyright information and links to other sections of the website application.
