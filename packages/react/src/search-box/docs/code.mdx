## Clear button and controlled input

If the user clicks the ‘Clear search’ and you are **controlling the component using the props `value` and `onChange`**, a synthetic object is passed in the argument for an `onChange` event.

The ‘Clear search’ function provides the target and some event attributes, but you cannot run any native event functions.

```jsx
const [value, setValue] = useState("Initial value");
<SearchBoxInput
    ...
    onChange={(event) => setValue(event.target.value)}
    value={value}
/>
```

If you identify a use case that requires require the `ChangeEvent` properties that have not been provided by the ‘Clear search’ button, [please contact the Design System team](/about#connect-with-us).
