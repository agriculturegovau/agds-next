	<SearchBoxButton>Search</SearchBoxButton>
</SearchBox>
```

Use the `SearchBox` component to help users find content or pages through keywords. This can be particularly useful for a web service with a large amount of pages.

<DoHeading />

- use to allow users to search for and discover content
- include placeholder text to explain what the box is for
- use to search for content on a server

<DontHeading />

- use to filter information that has loaded â€“ use SearchInput
- indicate that the field is optional
- include a label.

### Responsive icon

Use the `iconOnly` prop to configure at which breakpoints the search icon should replace the button label. This allows more space for text to be written in the text input.

```jsx live
<SearchBox onSubmit={console.log}>
	<SearchBoxInput label="Search this website" />
	<SearchBoxButton iconOnly={{ xs: true, md: false }}>Search</SearchBoxButton>
</SearchBox>
```
