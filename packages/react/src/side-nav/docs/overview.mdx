The side navigation allows users to find other pages which share a similar topic or section. By default, it supports three levels of nesting along with an accompanying heading.

On mobile and smaller viewports, the side navigation uses functionality from the accordion component to collapse down to an expandable element.

The background of the `SideNav` must match the background it is being placed on. For example, if `SideNav` is placed on a `bodyAlt` background, please set the `background` prop to `'bodyAlt'`.

<DoHeading />

- include a concise label
- indent each nesting level

<DontHeading />

- create more than 3 levels of nesting
- place on the right-hand side of content.
