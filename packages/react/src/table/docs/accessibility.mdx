Learn more about how to meet WCAG success criteria when implementing tables. This makes them accessible and inclusive for users of all abilities and situations.

The table component passed accessibility testing in 2022 and 2024.

## ARIA usage for enhanced accessibility

### Requirements

- Only add ARIA when semantic HTML is insufficient.
- Include `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` when `<TableCaption>` or other visible text is insufficient.
- Use `aria-rowcount` to define total number of table rows in a paginated table.
- Use `aria-rowindex` on `TableRow` to define a row’s position in a paginated table.
- Use `aria-selected` when selecting a row for a batch action.
- Use `aria-described-by`or `VisuallyHidden` on table actions when the visible text is insufficient – for example, ‘Edit’ fits into a table, but ‘Edit record 2’ doesn’t.

### Benefits

- Communicates table purpose and context to assistive technology users.
- Clarifies the current state of a table and its rows.
- Improves the navigational experience for screen reader users.
- Provides feedback on the results of user interactions.
- Ensures all users have equal access to functionality.

## Clear captions

### Requirements

- `<Table>` has a caption that is clear and succinct in the way it describes the purpose of the table.
- The caption is associated with the correct table by putting the `<TableCaption>` component immediately after the opening `<Table>` tag in your code.

### Benefits

- Helps users understand the table’s purpose before navigating its contents.
- Provides context for screen readers users.
- Enhances document structure and navigation.
- Makes tables more discoverable in page content.
- Aids users in determining if the table is relevant to their needs.

- [Understanding success criterion 2.4.6 Headings and labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels.html)

## Semantic structure

### Requirements

- Use the provided components and sub-components to enforce the correct structure of a table – for example, `<TableRow>`, `<TableHeader>`, `<TableCell>`.
- Avoid merged or split cells unless they have proper header associations that are understood and conveyed by assistive technology.
- Set the appropriate `scope` attribute on `<TableHeader>` – for example, `scope="row"`, `scope="col"`.

### Benefits

- Screen readers can accurately convey which column and row the cell data is for.
- Improves understanding of data relationships for all users.
