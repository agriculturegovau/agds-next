SideDrawers are ideal for prompting a user to confirm a destructive action.

For other uses, other patterns are preferred.

<DoHeading />

- use to confirm a destructive action â€“ for example, when cancelling a form and user input will be lost
- use a Button or Button group for actions
- include a Close button in the top right corner
- ensure the SideDrawer closes when the action is completed.

<DontHeading />

- change the Button group order
- remove the Close button
- change default behaviour
- use a SideDrawer to explain why a user cannot continue in a flow - use PageAlert
- embed forms in a SideDrawer
- use for error, success or loading messages.
