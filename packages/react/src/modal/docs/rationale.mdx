## Use modals sparingly

Modals interrupt the user journey so should only be used to provide critical information that helps inform a decision or prevent a detrimental action.

## Keep it brief

The modal experience should be a brief interaction with no more than two action buttons and a dismiss option (X in the top right corner). The modal closes when the action is completed.
