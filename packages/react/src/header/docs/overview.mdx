## Heading

Heading should be set to the website or service title.

## Subline

Subline can provide additional information to describe your website or service.

## Badge

We use a badge to indicate if an application is in a prerelease state. Use the `badgeLabel` prop to implement.

## Size

The `size` prop can be used to control the vertical height of the Header. Use the `sm` variant for internal applications where space is limited.

```jsx live
<Box palette="dark">
	<Header
		heading="Export Service"
		subline="Supporting Australian agricultural exports"
		logo={<Logo />}
		background="bodyAlt"
		size="sm"
	/>
</Box>
