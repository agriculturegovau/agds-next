```jsx live
<GlobalAlert title="Alert title">
	<Text as="p">
		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Fusce massa nibh,

</GlobalAlert>

Global alerts are used to display system-wide alerts that are critical for a user to see. They are used to communicate high-signal messages, such as system alerts.

Global alerts should be used sparingly due to their prominent nature. They should also be used in coordination with every product team, to ensure it is treated consistently across microfrontends.

<DoHeading />

- place alerts at the top of the page above the Header
- keep text concise
- explain the problem/issue and (if possible) when it will be resolved
- offer an alternative path to contact or support if possible
- consider adding a Close button so users can easily dismiss the alert.
- use a title to provide a short summary of the alert

<DontHeading />

- use for anything that's not system level
- let alert banners time out.

## Dismissable

Global alerts can be dismissed by a user if they have understood the message and no longer need to see it.

Use the `onDismiss` prop to make the alert dismissable. Ensure Global alerts that are closed by the user are never seen again. You could do this through a feature flag in a database, or by setting a value in the browser.

```jsx live
<GlobalAlert title="Alert title" onDismiss={console.log}>
	<Text as="p">
		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Fusce massa nibh,
		aliquam vel dolor non, gravida porttitor nulla. Pellentesque cursus orci
		vulputate nibh sagittis blandit.
	</Text>
</GlobalAlert>
```

## Infomation alert

An `info` version of Global alert is also available, which can be used to display system-wide information messages which are not negative in nature.

This could include a general announcement about a feature or policy. This variant should be used sparingly.

```jsx live
<GlobalAlert title="Information" tone="info">
	<Text as="p">
		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Fusce massa nibh,
		aliquam vel dolor non, gravida porttitor nulla. Pellentesque cursus orci
		vulputate nibh sagittis blandit.
	</Text>
</GlobalAlert>
```
