```jsx live
<div aria-label="Site" role="search">
	<SearchInput label="Search" />
</div>
```

The `SearchInput` component can be used as a filter to aid the user in finding content that has already been loaded on the page.

For use cases where you need a search form with a submit button, the [Search Box](/components/search-box) component can be used instead.

By default, the `SearchInput` component does not expand to fill the available space.

<DoHeading />

- use to filter results on a page
- provide a meaningful label – for example, Search components
- wrap in an appropriately labelled `role="search"` landmark
- hide the ‘optional’ label.

<DontHeading />

- use to fetch results from a server – use SearchBox or Autocomplete
- hide the search icon or clear button
- use for global site search - use SearchBox.

## Hint

Use the `hint` prop to provide help that’s relevant to the majority of users, like how their information will be used, or where to find it.

Don’t use long paragraphs and lists in hint text. Screen readers read out the entire text when users interact with the form element. This could frustrate users if the text is long.

Don’t include links within hint text. While screen readers will read out the link text when describing the field, they will not tell users that the text is a link.

```jsx live
<SearchInput label="Search" hint="Hint text" />
```

## Required

The `required` prop can be used to indicate that user input is required on the field before a form can be submitted.

Required fields do not append ‘(optional)’ to the label and also use [aria-required](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-required) to indicate to screen readers that the field is required.

### Hide optional label

The `hideOptionalLabel` prop can be used in situations where you want to indicate to screen reader users that a field is optional but don’t want to show the ‘(optional)’ label.

The usage of `hideOptionalLabel` should be reserved for inputs that filter data in a table or chart, and should never be used in standard forms for submitting information.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<SearchInput label="Required" required />
	<SearchInput label="Optional" required={false} />
	<SearchInput
		label="Optional with hideOptionalLabel"
		required={false}
		hideOptionalLabel={true}
	/>
</Stack>
```

## Invalid

Use the `invalid` prop to indicate if the user input is invalid.

```jsx live
<SearchInput
	label="Invalid"
	invalid
	message="A search term is required to see results"
/>
```

## Disabled

Disabled input elements are unusable and can not be clicked. This prevents a user from interacting with the input element until another action is complete.

```jsx live
<SearchInput label="Search" disabled />
```

## Block

Use the `block` prop to expand the component to fill the available space.

```jsx live
<SearchInput label="Search" block />
```
