Autocomplete benefits the user experience by making forms or tasks faster and easier to complete. It is also a feature used in Comboboxes and search tools and bars.

`Autocomplete` is a [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) which means consumers of this component need to manage the state of this component by using the `value` and `onChange` props.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);
	return (
		<Autocomplete
			label="Find your country"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
			loadOptions={async function loadOptions(inputValue) {
				// Simulate a slow network call
				await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
				return COUNTRY_OPTIONS;
			}}
		/>
	);
};
```

<DoHeading />

- use to help people complete input from an API
- use for address input
- use where spelling or data entry might be challenging
- use to order results in a meaningful way
- indicate whether input is optional
- ensure users can easily filter a list of options
- provide hint text for instruction
- deliver suggestions in real-time for low latency.

<DontHeading />

- show more than 10 results at a time
- use if the list of possible results is small - use Radio instead.

## Loading options

Use the `loadOptions` prop to load options from a remote source as the user types.

This is a function that returns a promise, which is the set of options to be used once the promise resolves.

## Block

Use the `block` prop to expand the component to fill the available space.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);
	return (
		<Autocomplete
			label="Find your country"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			block
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
			loadOptions={async function loadOptions(inputValue) {
				// Simulate a slow network call
				await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
				return COUNTRY_OPTIONS;
			}}
		/>
	);
};
```

## Required

The `required` prop can be used to indicate that user input is required on the field before a form can be submitted.

Using the `required` prop, this component will automatically append "(optional)" to the label as well as using [aria-required](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-required) to indicate to screen reader user that the field is required.

### Hide optional label

The `hideOptionalLabel` prop can be used in situations where you want to indiciate to screen reader users that a field is optional but don't want to show the "(optional)" label.

The usage of `hideOptionalLabel` should be reserved for inputs that filter data in a table or chart, and should never be used in standard forms for submitting information.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);
	return (
		<Autocomplete
			label="Find your country"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			required
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
			loadOptions={async function loadOptions(inputValue) {
				// Simulate a slow network call
				await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
				return COUNTRY_OPTIONS;
			}}
		/>
	);
};
```

## Invalid

Use the `invalid` prop to indicate if the user input is invalid (does not validate according to the elements settings).

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);
	const invalid = !value;
	return (
		<Autocomplete
			label="Find your country"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			invalid={invalid}
			message={invalid ? 'State is required' : undefined}
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
			loadOptions={async function loadOptions(inputValue) {
				// Simulate a slow network call
				await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
				return COUNTRY_OPTIONS;
			}}
		/>
	);
};
```

## Disabled

Disabled input elements are unusable and can not be clicked. This prevents a user from interacting with the input element until another action is complete.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(null);
	return (
		<Autocomplete
			label="Find your country"
			hint="Start typing to see results"
			disabled
			value={value}
			onChange={setValue}
			loadOptions={async function loadOptions(inputValue) {
				// Simulate a slow network call
				await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
				return COUNTRY_OPTIONS;
			}}
		/>
	);
};
```
