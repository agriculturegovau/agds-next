Dropdown menu 

A dropdown menu displays a list of actions when a trigger is pressed. 

 

Learn more about how to meet WCAG success criteria when implementing dropdown menus. This makes them accessible and inclusive for users of all abilities and situations. 

The dropdown component passed accessibility testing 2024. 

 

Clear and descriptive labels 

Requirements 

Dropdowns and their menu items have clear, concise labels that describe the action. We recommend using verb and noun pairs – for example: ‘Remove access’, ‘Approve application’, ‘Delete record’. 

The purpose of the dropdown menu and its actions are understood and conveyed by assistive technology. 

 

Benefits 

Improves understanding of available actions. 

Reduces the cognitive load for all users. 

Supports users with cognitive disabilities through clear labelling. 

Helps users predict outcomes of interactions. 

Clear labelling supports users with English as a second language. 

Assistive technology users have equal access to information about the purpose of the component.

Consistent identification 

Requirements 

Components with the same functionality have consistent identification – for example to remove an item from a table, the actions dropdown menus should always use ‘Delete’ or always use ‘Remove’. Mixing terms can lead to confusion about what happens when the menu item is activated. 

 

Benefits 

Improves learnability. 

Reduces the cognitive load for all users. 

Increases accessibility for users with cognitive disabilities.

Label in accessible name 

Requirements 

Visible dropdown labels must match the beginning of the accessible name. If you want to avoid horizontal scroll in a table, you may not have space to include a noun/verb pair. For example, the visible label might read ‘Actions’, but the accessible name is ’Actions - Record 2’. 

 

Benefits 

Screen reader users hear the action that will occur when the menu item is used. 

People who use speech recognition can activate the menu item by saying the text they see on the dropdown option.

Name, role, value 

Requirements 

All dropdown actions have appropriate names, roles and values that are understood and conveyed by assistive technology. 

Clear label identifying the dropdown and its actions. 

ARIA roles and states where needed – for example, `aria-expanded`, `role=menuitemradio`). 

 

Benefits 

Assistive technology users have equal access to information on the state of the component. 

Improves usability for voice control software users. 

Helps users with cognitive challenges understand component functionality. 

Makes automation and testing more reliable.

Semantic markup 

Requirements 

Code is marked up in the most semantic way possible.  

`DropdownMenuItem` components use the menuitem role. 

`DropdownMenuItemRadio` component uses the menuitemradio role. 

 

Benefits 

Ensures proper functionality across different assistive devices. 

Ensures built-in keyboard accessibility without additional code. 

Simplifies development by leveraging built-in browser behaviours. 

Makes maintenance easier by using standard patterns. 

Improves compatibility across different assistive technologies.
