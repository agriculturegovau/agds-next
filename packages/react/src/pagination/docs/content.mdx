## Items range text

We use text to display the range of items currently displayed in the data. This text can be modified to suit your needs, but it must follow the guidelines below.

- Show the range of items currently displayed in the data (1-10)
- Show the total number of items in the data (125)
- Use a word that describes the data being displayed. This word should be pluralized to match the total number of items in the data. For example, "certificates" or "applications". Otherwise use "results" or "items".

For example:

- "1-10 of 125 certificates"
- "1-10 of 125 applications"
- "1-10 of 125 results"
- "1-10 of 125 items"
