```jsx live
<Pagination
	currentPage={5}
	totalPages={10}
	generateHref={(page) => `/example?page=${page}`}
/>
```

Pagination allows users to see total number of pages, which page they are viewing, and how to navigate to other pages.

Use pagination to separate large lists of content, such as search results, into smaller lists that are easier to interact with. Showing content on several pages prevents your content from becoming too long and overwhelming.

<DoHeading />

- use to enable navigation to a large data set such as a long list of results
- use for table listings, search results, and directories
- indicate the current page
- always place directly below the content you are paginating
- centre align with the content you are paginating.

<DontHeading />

- display more than 5 page numbers between the ellipses dividers
- left or right align with the content you are paginating.

## Pagination Buttons

By default, the `Pagination` component renders a link for each list item. We strongly recommend using wherever possible as it the most inclusive and accessible solution for users.

This requires you to manage the state of the current page in the URL, which usually fine, but in scenarios where that isn't possible we offer a `PaginationButtons` component.

`PaginationButtons` renders a button element for each list item which makes it possible to manage the state outside of the URL, e.g. `React.useState`.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = React.useState(5);
	return (
		<PaginationButtons
			currentPage={currentPage}
			onChange={setCurrentPage}
			totalPages={10}
		/>
	);
};
```
