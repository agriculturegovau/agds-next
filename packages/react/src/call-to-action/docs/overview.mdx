```jsx live
<CallToActionLink href="#">Sign up</CallToActionLink>
```

A simple and clear link to direct users to a preferred action.

<DoHeading />

- use verbs such as Get help or Learn more
- use primary and secondary variants if more than one is required
- use as either a button or linked text
- order hierarchy of CTAs from left to right in order of importance
- ensure the label indicates where the user is going.

<DontHeading />

- use inconsistent labels â€“ define the wording for each action and employ across the service
- write more than 3-4 words per CTA
- let text run over two lines
- use for actions such as submitting a form or indicating a changing state.

## CallToActionButton

For situations where you need the appearance of a `CallToActionLink` but the functionality of a HTML `button` element, you can use the `CallToActionButton` component.

```jsx live
<CallToActionButton onClick={console.log}>Sign up</CallToActionButton>
```
