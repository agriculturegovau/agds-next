A simple and clear link to direct users to a preferred action.

```jsx live
<CallToActionLink href="#">Sign up</CallToActionLink>
```

## CallToActionButton

For situations where you need the appearance of a `CallToActionLink` but the functionality of a HTML `button` element, you can use the `CallToActionButton` component.

```jsx live
<CallToActionButton onClick={console.log}>Sign up</CallToActionButton>
```
