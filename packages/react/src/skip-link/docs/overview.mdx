```jsx
<React.Fragment>
	<SkipLinks
		links={[
			{ href: '#main-content', label: 'Skip to main content' },
			{ href: '#main-nav', label: 'Skip to main navigation' },
		]}
	/>
	<MainNav id="main-nav" ... />
	<main id="main-content" tabIndex={-1} css={{ '&:focus': { outline: 'none' } }}>
		...
	</main>
</React.Fragment>
```

Skip links help keyboard-only users skip top-level navigation items and go to the main content on a page. Skip links are not visual until they receive focus. Include skip links after the opening of the `<body>` tag.

Skip links can be read by screen readers and exist to address [WCAG2.0 Criterion 2.4.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html).

<DoHeading />

- include between the opening of the <body> and the page <header>
- use a label for screen readers – for example, Skip to main content
- use for skipping to important UI elements such as Main navigation and Main content
- make sure links go to the correct location.

<DontHeading />

- have more than 5 on a page
- use for unimportant elements such as the footer
- link to content on other pages.
