Skip links are not visual until they receive focus. Include skip links after the opening of the `<body>` tag.

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
	<SkipLinks
		links={[
			{ href: '#main-content', label: 'Skip to main content' },
			{ href: '#main-nav', label: 'Skip to main navigation' },
		]}
	/>
	<MainNav id="main-nav" ... />
	<main id="main-content">
		...
	</main>
</React.Fragment>
```
