The inpage nav (or page contents) is placed above sections of a page and provides navigation to individual anchor links located in those sections.

<DoHeading />

- use to improve discoverability by allowing users to skip sections they don’t need
- ensure the anchor link text and section title are the same
- use unique, accurate headings to describe section content
- use for longer pages as a table of contents.

<DontHeading />

- use to navigate to another page – consider a Text link or Link list.
