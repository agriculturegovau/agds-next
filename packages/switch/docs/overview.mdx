A Switch Allows a User to choose between two mutually exclusive options, which immediately affect the interface.

Common usecases include changing boolean (true/false) options in filtering interfaces and settings menus.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [isGridVisible, setGridVisible] = React.useState(false);
	return (
		<Switch
			label="Show gridlines"
			checked={isGridVisible}
			onChange={setGridVisible}
		/>
	);
};
```

A Switch should not be used in Forms. Instead, a Checkbox or Radio component should be used.
