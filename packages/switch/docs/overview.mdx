A Switch allows a user to toggle a setting on or off, immediately affecting the user interface. Common use-cases include filtering interfaces and settings menus.

A Switch should not be used in Forms. Instead, a Checkbox or Radio component should be used.

```jsx live
() => {
	const [isGridVisible, setGridVisible] = React.useState(false);
	return (
		<Switch
			label="Show gridlines"
			checked={isGridVisible}
			onChange={setGridVisible}
		/>
	);
};
```
