The `Core` component should wrap your entire application, which will enable our CSS variables reset styles.

### Theming

The `Core` component accepts a `theme` prop that enables overwriting of the default theme.

```jsx
import { Core } from '@ag.ds-next/core';

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
	return (
		<Core theme={theme}>
			<Component {...pageProps} />
		</Core>
	);
}
```

### Routing / Linking

Our component library has been designed to work with any react routing library. For an example of configuring routing/links in AgDS for a Next.js application, please see [our example site](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/tree/main/example-site/components/LinkComponent.tsx).

```jsx
import { Core } from '@ag.ds-next/core';

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
	return (
		<Core theme={theme} linkComponent={LinkComponent}>
			<Component {...pageProps} />
		</Core>
	);
}
```
