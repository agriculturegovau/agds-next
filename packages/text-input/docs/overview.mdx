## Default

By default, the `TextInput` component does not expand to fill the available space.

```jsx live
<TextInput label="Name" />
```

## Block

Use the `block` prop to expand the component to fill the available space.

```jsx live
<TextInput label="Name" block />
```

## Required

The `required` prop can be used to indicate that user input is required on the field before a form can be submitted.

Using the `required` prop, this component will automatically append "(optional)" to the label as well as using [aria-required](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-required) to indicate to screen reader user that the field is required.

### Hide optional label

The `hideOptionalLabel` prop can be used in situations where you want to indiciate to screen reader users that a field is optional but don't want to show the "(optional)" label.

The usage of `hideOptionalLabel` should be reserved for inputs that filter data in a table or chart, and should never be used in standard forms for submitting information.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<TextInput label="Required" required />
	<TextInput label="Optional" required={false} />
	<TextInput
		label="Optional with hideOptionalLabel"
		required={false}
		hideOptionalLabel={true}
	/>
</Stack>
```

## Invalid

Use the `invalid` prop to indicate if the user input is invalid (does not validate according to the elements settings).

```jsx live
<TextInput label="Invalid" invalid message="This input is invalid" />
```

## Disabled

Disabled input elements are unusable and can not be clicked. This prevents a user from interacting with the input element until another action is complete. Disabled input elements in a form will not be submitted.

```jsx live
<TextInput label="Name" disabled />
```

## Maximum widths

The width of a text input field should indicate the amount of information expected to be entered into the field. The size of the text input acts as a visual constraint for the end user.

As an example, input fields for postcodes should have a smaller width than fields for emails.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={1}>
	<TextInput label="xs input" maxWidth="xs" />
	<TextInput label="sm input" maxWidth="sm" />
	<TextInput label="md input" maxWidth="md" />
	<TextInput label="lg input" maxWidth="lg" />
	<TextInput label="xl input" maxWidth="xl" />
</Stack>
```
