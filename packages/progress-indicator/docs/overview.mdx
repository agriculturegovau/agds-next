Our design system provides a progress indicator for larger tasks that can be completed out of order and returned to at a later date, like doing a tax return or applying for a driver’s licence.

The individual tasks or steps are shown as either:

- `todo` – the task is available for the user to do
- `doing` – the task has been started
- `done` – the task has been completed
- `blocked` – the task is not available yet for the user to do

```jsx live
<ProgressIndicator
	items={[
		{ href: '#', label: 'Introduction', status: 'done' },
		{ href: '#', label: 'Business Contacts', status: 'doing' },
		{ href: '#', label: 'Case Studies', status: 'todo' },
		{ href: '#', label: 'Attachments', status: 'blocked' },
	]}
/>
```

The background of the `ProgressIndicator` must match the background it is being placed on. For example, if `ProgressIndicator` is placed on a 'bodyAlt' background, please set the `background` prop to `bodyAlt`.

<DoHeading />

- display steps in order from top to bottom
- use in forms and multi-page processes
- use for processes of 2 – 10 steps
- always present mobile menu Closed by default
- pair with Task List if nesting is required
- ensure step names match H1s and truncate if long
- keyword frontload
- group related form fields.

<DontHeading />

- use for fewer than 2 steps
- have any other components in the left-hand column
- add the step number to the text - list only the action the user needs to take
- mix with other navigation patterns – for example, Side-nav
- change labels or icons
- make progress indicators a sticky nav item as this may cause reading order issues.

### Buttons

If an item does not specify a `href` attribute a `button` element will be rendered. This enables you to reponds to various mouse events such as `onClick`.

```jsx live
<ProgressIndicator
	items={[
		{ onClick: console.log, label: 'Introduction', status: 'done' },
		{ onClick: console.log, label: 'Business Contacts', status: 'doing' },
		{ onClick: console.log, label: 'Case Studies', status: 'todo' },
		{ onClick: console.log, label: 'Attachments', status: 'blocked' },
	]}
/>
```
