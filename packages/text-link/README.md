This package includes the components `<TextLink />`, `<TextButton />` and `<TextLinkExternal />`.

The `TextLink` component creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.

```jsx live
<Text>
	This is some text with <TextLink href="#">a link</TextLink> inside.
</Text>
```

## TextButton

For situations where you need the appearance of a `TextLink` but the functionality of a HTML `button` element, you can use the `TextButton` component.

```jsx live
<Text>
	This is some text with <TextButton onClick={console.log}>a button</TextButton>{' '}
	inside.
</Text>
```

## TextLinkExternal

For the most part, always open links in the same browser tab or window. There is generally one good reason to open a page in a new window, and that is that the user will need to refer to that content in order to complete a task in another window.

In those situations, the `TextLinkExternal` component can be used to create a link that opens in a new tab and includes descriptive text to communicate the interaction to a screenreader user.

```jsx live
<Text>
	Interact with our components in{' '}
	<TextLinkExternal href="https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/playroom/index.html">
		Playroom
	</TextLinkExternal>
	.
</Text>
```
