## StatusBadge

Use `StatusBadge` to highlight an item's status for quick recognition.

Choosing a `tone` for StatusBadge allows the user to understand the importance and severity of the message at a glance.

The five supported tones are `info`, `success`, `error`, `warning` and `neutral`.

```jsx live
<Flex gap={1}>
	<StatusBadge tone="info" label="In progress" />
	<StatusBadge tone="success" label="Resolved" />
	<StatusBadge tone="error" label="Rejected" />
	<StatusBadge tone="warning" label="Attention" />
	<StatusBadge tone="neutral" label="Draft" />
</Flex>
```

## NotificationBadge

A notification badge is a visual indicator for numeric values.

```jsx live
<Flex gap={1}>
	<NotificationBadge tone="neutral" value={16} />
	<NotificationBadge tone="action" value={8} />
</Flex>
```

### Maximum value

Use the `max` property where the count is expected to exceed a reasonable number, and the exact count is not particularly valuable to the user.

```jsx live
<NotificationBadge tone="action" max={99} value={123} />
```

## IndicatorDot

A small decorative indicator used to call attention to an item, such as an unread message.

```jsx live
<Flex gap={1}>
	<IndicatorDot tone="neutral" />
	<IndicatorDot tone="action" />
</Flex>
```
