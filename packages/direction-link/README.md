Use direction links to indicate a physical direction, such as:

- Linking `up` or `down` within the page.
- Going `back` to a parent page.
- Showing the `next` or `previous` pages.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={2}>
	<DirectionLink href="#" direction="left">
		Back
	</DirectionLink>
	<DirectionLink href="#" direction="right">
		Next
	</DirectionLink>
	<DirectionLink href="#" direction="up">
		Top
	</DirectionLink>
	<DirectionLink href="#" direction="down">
		Skip to footer
	</DirectionLink>
</Stack>
```

### Buttons

Sometimes direction is needed inside a form. Buttons offer a way to direct users to the next or previous section inside a form.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={2}>
	<DirectionButton onClick={console.log} direction="left">
		Back
	</DirectionButton>
	<DirectionButton onClick={console.log} direction="right">
		Next
	</DirectionButton>
	<DirectionButton onClick={console.log} direction="up">
		Top
	</DirectionButton>
	<DirectionButton onClick={console.log} direction="down">
		Skip to footer
	</DirectionButton>
</Stack>
```
