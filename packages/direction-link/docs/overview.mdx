Use direction links to indicate a physical direction, such as:

- Linking `up` or `down` within the page.
- Going `back` to a parent page.
- Showing the `next` or `previous` pages.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={2}>
	<DirectionLink href="#" direction="left">
		Back
	</DirectionLink>
	<DirectionLink href="#" direction="right">
		Next
	</DirectionLink>
	<DirectionLink href="#" direction="up">
		Top
	</DirectionLink>
	<DirectionLink href="#" direction="down">
		Skip to footer
	</DirectionLink>
</Stack>
```

### DirectionButton

By default, the DirectionLink component renders a HTML anchor link. We strongly recommend using it wherever possible as it the most inclusive and accessible solution for users.

But using a link may be technically inappropriate for some single-page-app experiences, such as a multi-step form, where navigating to another web page would erase all user-entered form information.

`DirectionButton` offer a way to direct users through sections inside a form or single-page-app, without triggering a page navigation. It looks visually like a DirectionLink, but it renders a button element by default.

```jsx
<Stack gap={2}>
	<DirectionButton onClick={setCurrentSection(1)} direction="left">
		Back
	</DirectionButton>
	<DirectionButton onClick={setCurrentSection(2)} direction="right">
		Next
	</DirectionButton>
</Stack>
```
