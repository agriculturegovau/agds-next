Use direction links to indicate a physical direction, such as:

- Linking `up` or `down` within the page.
- Going `back` to a parent page.
- Showing the `next` or `previous` pages.

<DoHeading />

- use to link up or down within a page - for example, Back to top
- use to guide users back to a parent page
- use to show next or previous pages.

<DontHeading />

- use a link in place of a button.

```jsx live
<Stack gap={2}>
	<DirectionLink href="#" direction="left">
		Back
	</DirectionLink>
	<DirectionLink href="#" direction="right">
		Next
	</DirectionLink>
	<DirectionLink href="#" direction="up">
		Top
	</DirectionLink>
	<DirectionLink href="#" direction="down">
		Skip to footer
	</DirectionLink>
</Stack>
```

### DirectionButton

The `DirectionLink` component will render a HTML anchor tag. We strongly recommend using this wherever possible as it is the most inclusive and accessible solution for users.

But sometimes using a link may be technically inappropriate for some experiences, as navigating to another web page would reset some application state, such as user-entered form information.

`DirectionButton` provides the appearance of a `DirectionLink` but the functionality of a HTML `button` element.

```jsx
<Stack gap={2}>
	<DirectionButton onClick={() => goToPreviousStep()} direction="left">
		Back
	</DirectionButton>
	<DirectionButton onClick={() => goToNextStep()} direction="right">
		Next
	</DirectionButton>
</Stack>
```
