Here are ways to make an accordion more accessible and inclusive of users of any ability or environment.

For general help with accessibility, go to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

## Accordion titles

[2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0&showtechniques=246#headings-and-labels) and [G131: Providing descriptive labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G131.html) addresses accessibility criteria relevant to accordion titles. Check that each title makes an accordionâ€™s purpose clear.

## Tagging accordion titles

[Use h1 to h6 to identify headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H42.html) and tag accordion titles. They should follow the order and importance within the other headings on the page.
