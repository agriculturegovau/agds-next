### Default

Use the search box component to help users find content or pages through keywords. This can be particularly useful for a web service with a large amount of pages.

```jsx live
<Search label="Search this website" aria-label="Sitewide" />
```

### Responsive

The responsive variation replaces the button text with a search icon on smaller devices. This allows more space for text to be written in the text input.

```

```

### Controlled

```jsx live
	{() => {
		return <Search label="Search this website" aria-label="Sitewide" />;
	}}
</>
```
