The `SubNav` component is a horizontal list of links that can accommodate up to 5 items. It is best suited for navigation to persistent links, or to reveal additional content on the same page. The `SubNav` component sometimes accommodates the third level of the information architecture, following the [Side Nav](/packages/navigation/side-nav) on a content page. If you need more space for longer lists, consider another form of navigation such as the [Side Nav](/packages/navigation/side-nav), [Link List](/packages/navigation/link-list), [Inpage Nav](/packages/navigation/inpage-nav) or [Card lists](/packages/layout/card#card-lists).

The `SubNav` component is designed to collapse down to a static vertical list on smaller devices. Progressive disclosure should not be used to enclose the SubNav on small screens.

```jsx live
<SubNav
	activePath="#usage"
	links={[
		{ href: '#usage', label: 'Usage' },
		{ href: '#code', label: 'Code' },
		{ href: '#code', label: 'Content' },
		{ href: '#accessibility', label: 'Accessibility' },
	]}
/>
```

The background of the `SubNav` must match the background it is being placed on. For example, if `SubNav` is placed on a 'bodyAlt' background, please set the `background` prop to `bodyAlt`.
