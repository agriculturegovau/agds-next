A button indicates to a user what action will happen next.

There are 3 visual button weights that convey their order of importance: primary, secondary and tertiary.

Make sure you include a meaningful text label with or without an icon on a button.

**Do's**

- Use a button if the user needs to perform an action.
- Align buttons left from the most to least important action.
- Use one Primary button on a page. You can use more than one Secondary or Tertiary button.

**Dont's**

- Don‚Äôt use a button if a user needs to go somewhere. For example, another page. Use a link or link that looks like a button instead.
- Try to avoid using Disabled buttons.

## Primary

The Primary button is the default form of a button. It‚Äôs for the main action a user needs to complete on a page or a critical call to action.

A Primary button uses a solid background so it‚Äôs prominent on a page.

Only include one Primary button on a page.

```jsx live
<Button variant="primary">Primary button</Button>
```

## Secondary

A Secondary button has a clear background and border and uses a less prominent style than a Primary button. It highlights another common action to the user.

A Primary button usually already appears on a screen to use a Secondary button.

You can use more than one Secondary button on a page.

```jsx live
<Button variant="secondary">Secondary button</Button>
```

## Tertiary

A Tertiary button has no border to make it the least prominent button style. It‚Äôs for other minor actions on a screen.

A Secondary button usually already appears on a screen to use a Tertiary button. You can use more than one Tertiary button on a page.

```jsx live
<Button variant="tertiary">Tertiary button</Button>
```

## Block

A Block button uses the full width of the container or parent element.

Use it to make a button stand out to the user.

```jsx live
<Button type="submit" block>
	Submit
</Button>
```

## Loading

Use the Loading button to let users know their action is being processed.

```jsx live
<Button type="submit" loading>
	Submit
</Button>
```

## Disabled

A user can‚Äôt interact with a Disabled button which is usually greyed out. It indicates the user can‚Äôt take an action at that time in their journey.

Avoid using a Disabled button as much as possible. That is, unless usability testing suggests it‚Äôs easier for users to complete a form or other task.

Instead, allow users to interact with a button and receive feedback from the system.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup>
	<Button variant="primary" disabled>
		Primary
	</Button>
	<Button variant="secondary" disabled>
		Secondary
	</Button>
	<Button variant="tertiary" disabled>
		Tertiary
	</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```

## Icons

Generally use a button label and icon together not an icon on its own.

A button should have a meaningful text label with an icon, usually on the left or right of the label. That‚Äôs unless, an icon only fits in the space available.

For example, using a magnifying glass icon (üîç) to indicate to a user they can search for something on mobile.

```jsx live
<ButtonLink
	iconAfter={ExternalLinkIcon}
	href="https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next"
	target="_blank"
	rel="noopener noreferrer"
>
	Open external link
</ButtonLink>
```

## Links

You can implement buttons as links.

Use a button link when you need something with the visual weight and prominence of a button, but functionality of a link.

ButtonLink adopts the Link component from your chosen router framework, which you can set in the Core component.

```jsx live
<ButtonLink href="/sign-in">Sign in</ButtonLink>
```

## Size

Size is a property that allows you to adjust the visual weight of a button.

The medium button should be used for most circumstances.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup>
	<Button variant="primary" size="sm">
		Primary
	</Button>
	<Button variant="secondary" size="sm">
		Secondary
	</Button>
	<Button variant="tertiary" size="sm">
		Tertiary
	</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```
