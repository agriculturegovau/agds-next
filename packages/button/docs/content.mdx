For general guidance on content, go to the TFTM content patterns.

**Length**

Label: up to 20 characters.

**Structure**

Label: Start with a verb and end with a noun where there is space. Don’t use, conjunctions, prepositions and pronouns inbetween.

For example, ‘Edit Establishment’, not ‘Edit my Establishment’ or ‘View corrective action’, not ‘View’. If space is limited, use a verb then only.

**Language**

Label: use a concise, unique and meaningful text label. The label text should describe the specific action that happens next if the user selects it.

Try to avoid using general labels that don't provide the full context. For example, ‘Read more’.
