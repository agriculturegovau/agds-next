Here are ways to make a button more accessible and inclusive of users of any ability or environment.

For more help, go to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1.

**Use accessible button labels**

The visual text label is the accessible name of a button with an icon in the page code. It’s read aloud by screen readers.

Include the text of the visible label in the accessible name in the code to help speech input users. For example, ‘View Corrective Action 12345’.

It especially helps those with cognitive, language and learning disabilities enter information correctly, or avoid submitting an incomplete form.

Go to Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions for more guidance.

**Buttons as links**

You can implement a button as a link (`<a>`) or button (`<button>`).

Mark up the code in the most semantic way possible.

Using incorrect HTML in some situations can cause accessibility issues.

Go to G115: Using semantic elements to markup structure for important information about techniques.

**Hover**

Buttons have an underline on hover to address WCAG2.0 Criterion 1.4.1 Use of Color:

Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. (Level A)

However, the ‘focus’ state is not underlined as it’s conveyed using the global focus outline.

Go to our Global design guidelines for more guidance.
