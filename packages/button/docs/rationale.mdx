Here are the reasons why our buttons appear or work the way they do.

**Align buttons left**

It’s predictable for the user if you align buttons consistently to the left.

A user can miss buttons that align to the right. That’s especially if they use a screen magnifier.

**Meaningful text labels**

It may be clear to some users what a button relates to due to what’s around it. For example, a button in a table. But it may not be to others.

A meaningful button label with a noun and verb makes the action that happens next obvious to all users and easy to scan.

**Avoid using Disabled buttons**

A Disabled button can confuse the user as:

- it doesn’t give a reason why it’s greyed out and they can’t select it, and
- it can be hard for a user with eyesight difficulties to see.

A Disabled button is also not keyboard accessible.

**Visual loudness**

There are several button forms to allow for different levels of visual loudness. You can use visual loudness to prioritise a button.

Choose a button form that balances the visual priority of content on a page.

For example, users with low literacy can use a visually loud button to help complete their task.

**Button label and icon**

Use a button label with an icon and avoid using buttons with icons only where possible.

**Buttons with icons only can confuse users who may mistake the icon for an incorrect action.**

For example, an ‘x’ can close a page but also indicate an error to the user.
