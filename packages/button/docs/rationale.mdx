Here are the reasons why our buttons appear or work the way they do.

## Align buttons left

It’s predictable for the user if you align buttons consistently to the left as English is read from left to right.

A user can miss buttons that align to the right, especially on large screens or if they use a screen magnifier.

## Meaningful text labels

It may be clear to some users what a button action is due to what’s around it. For example, an “edit” button in a row of a table would allow a user to edit that row. But it may not be to others.

A [meaningful button label](/components/button/content) with a noun and verb makes the action that happens next obvious to all users and easy to scan.

## Don’t use disabled buttons

A [disabled button](/components/button#disabled) can confuse users as:

- it doesn’t give a reason why it’s unavailable causing some users to get stuck,
- it can be hard for a user with a visual impairment to see,
- it is not not keyboard accessible.

## Button label and icon

Always use a visible label with an icon in a button unless there’s insufficient space.

Buttons with icons and no visible label can confuse users who may mistake the icon for an incorrect action. For example, an ‘x’ can close a page but also indicate an error to the user.
