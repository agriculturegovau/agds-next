## Props

### Variant

Our Button component has three visual weights, to convey heirarchy.

#### Primary

A strong button style used for primary actions on a screen such as a Submit button on a form, or other actions that are critical in a user workflow. A primary button should be only used once per view.

#### Secondary

A standard button style used to highlight an important action such as a Save button on a form. (A secondary button assumes there is already a primary button.)

#### Tertiary

A light button style used for tertiary actions on a screen such as a Cancel button on a form. (A tertiary button assumes there is already a secondary button.) Typically it performs the opposite action to the secondary button (e.g. Cancel vs Save).

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup>
	<Button variant="primary" onClick={() => alert('primary')}>
		Primary
	</Button>
	<Button variant="secondary" onClick={() => alert('secondary')}>
		Secondary
	</Button>
	<Button variant="tertiary" onClick={() => alert('tertiary')}>
		Tertiary
	</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```

### Size

Size is another prop that allows adjustment of visual weight. The medium button should be used for most circumstances.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup>
	<Button variant="primary" size="sm" onClick={() => alert('primary')}>
		Primary
	</Button>
	<Button variant="secondary" size="sm" onClick={() => alert('secondary')}>
		Secondary
	</Button>
	<Button variant="tertiary" size="sm" onClick={() => alert('tertiary')}>
		Tertiary
	</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```

### Disabled

A button that canâ€™t be interacted with. A disabled button is typically greyed out to indicate to users that they cannot undertake the action associated with it. This is usually for page logic reasons.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup>
	<Button disabled variant="primary" onClick={() => alert('primary')}>
		Primary
	</Button>
	<Button disabled variant="secondary" onClick={() => alert('secondary')}>
		Secondary
	</Button>
	<Button disabled variant="tertiary" onClick={() => alert('tertiary')}>
		Tertiary
	</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```

### Block

A block-level button uses 100% of the available width of the container or parent element. A block- level button is used for visual prominence.

```jsx live
<Button block>Submit</Button>
```

### Icons

The `iconAfter` and `iconBefore` props can be used to add system icons to buttons.

```jsx live
<ButtonLink
	iconAfter={ExternalLinkIcon}
	href="https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next"
	target="_blank"
	rel="noopener noreferrer"
>
	Open external link
</ButtonLink>
```

### Loading

The `loading` prop can be used to inform users that their action is being processed.

```jsx live
<Button loading>Submit</Button>
```

## Buttons links

For situations where you need something that has the visual weight of a Button, but the functionality of a link, you can use `ButtonLink`!

`ButtonLink` adopts the `Link` component from your chosen router framework, which you can set in the `Core` component.

```jsx live
<ButtonLink href="/sign-in">Sign in</ButtonLink>
```

## ButtonGroup

The `ButtonGroup` component can be used to group buttons whose actions are related. On smaller devices, buttons will be stacked vertically and stretch to expand the width of the container.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup>
	<Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>
	<Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>
	<Button variant="tertiary">Tertiary</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```
