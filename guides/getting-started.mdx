title: Getting started
---

Welcome to AgDS - the Design System for the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment.

In this guide, we're going to go through the steps necessary to get started with the React component library from our Design System.

## What is React?

React is a popular framework for building User Interfaces, which our component library is built on.

If you’re new to React we recommend going through official [React getting started documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html), and follow along using the [React Hello World CodePen example](http://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/ZpvBNJ?editors=0010).

## If you’re starting a new project…

We have built an [example site](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/tree/main/example-site) in [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) which you can clone and use as a starting point.

## If you’re implementing components in an existing project…

All of our AgDS components can be used in your existing React application.

In order to get everything working, go through the following steps...

### 1. Install Emotion

Emotion is a CSS-in-JS library which our component library uses. Install Emotion by running the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn add @emotion/react facepaint` in your terminal.
```

### 2. Install AgDS packages

Install the following, and any other AgDS packages you need, by running the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn add @ag.ds-next/ag-branding @ag.ds-next/box @ag.ds-next/core @ag.ds-next/text
```

### 3. Wrap your application in our `Core` component…

The `Core` component is responsible for enabling our CSS variables, and also make your chosen framework's Link component available to all of the AgDS components. For more information of configuring link components in AgDS, please see [our example site](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/tree/main/example-site/components/LinkComponent.tsx).

```jsx
// This example assumes you are using NextJS.
import Link, { LinkProps } from 'next/link';
import { Core } from '@ag.ds-next/core';
import { theme } from '@ag.ds-next/ag-branding';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
	return (
		<Core theme={theme} linkComponent={Link}>
			<Component {...pageProps} />
		</Core>
	);
}

export default MyApp;
```

You can now start using our components!

> We recommend using TypeScript to get the most out of these components. Our [example site](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/tree/main/example-site) already uses TypeScript so you can use that as reference.

## What's next?

Take a look at our wide range of [components](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages), and install the ones you need in your application.

If you get stuck, feel free to reach out to us in the Design System Teams Chat.
