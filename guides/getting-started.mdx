title: Getting started
---

Welcome to AgDS - the Design System for the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment.

In this guide we are going to go through the steps necessary to get started with the React component library from our Design System.

## What is React?

Our component library is built with React, a popular javascript library for building User Interfaces.

If you’re new to React we recommend going through official [React getting started documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) and follow along using the [React Hello World CodePen example](http://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/ZpvBNJ?editors=0010).

## If you’re starting a new project…

We have built a [starter kit](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next-starter-kit) in NextJS, Typescript and Emotion which you can clone and use as a starting point for your next project.

### 1. Clone latest code

These commands clone the latest starter kit code, without the version history or ties to the remote repository.

```sh
git clone --depth=1 --branch=main git@github.com:steelthreads/agds-next-starter-kit.git my-app
rm -rf ./my-app/.git
```

### 2. Create new git repository

The code has been downloaded, but you probably want to set up your own version control. **Rename the project `name` in `package.json`** and then initialise git.

```sh
git init
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Now run the following commands to install packages and run the project.

```sh
yarn && yarn dev
```

## If you’re implementing components in an existing project…

All of our AgDS components can be used in existing React applications. To get everything set up, we need to go through the following steps:

### 1. Install dependencies

Our component library uses the CSS-in-JS styling libraries Emotion and Facepaint which need to be installed as dependencies in your application. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
yarn add @emotion/react facepaint
```

You will also need to configure the emotion babel plugin for the minification and optimization of emotion styles.

```
yarn add --dev @emotion/babel-plugin
```

Your `.babelrc` should contain:

```
{
  "plugins": ["@emotion"]
}
```

If you're using typescript, your TSConfig `compilerOptions` should contain:

```

"jsx": "react-jsx",
"jsxImportSource": "@emotion/react"

```

Fore more information about using emotion with typescript, please refer to the [official documentation](https://emotion.sh/docs/typescript).

### 2. Install base AgDS packages

Install the following packages, and any other AgDS packages you need, by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
yarn add @ag.ds-next/core @ag.ds-next/ag-branding @ag.ds-next/box @ag.ds-next/text
```

### 3. Wrap your application in our `Core` component

The `Core` component needs to wrap your entire application and it is where you can configure the theme and routing/links. For an example of configuring routing/links in AgDS for a Next.js application, please see [our example site](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/tree/main/example-site/components/LinkComponent.tsx).

```tsx
// This example assumes you are using NextJS
// This is an example of `_app.tsx`

import { PropsWithChildren } from 'react';
import Link, { LinkProps } from 'next/link';
import { Core } from '@ag.ds-next/core';
import { theme } from '@ag.ds-next/ag-branding';

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
	return (
		<Core theme={theme} linkComponent={LinkComponent}>
			<Component {...pageProps} />
		</Core>
	);
}

// If you are not using Next.js and instead using something like react-router, this `LinkComponent` will need to be configured differently

type NextLinkProps = Omit<LinkProps, 'as' | 'href'>;

type LinkComponentProps = PropsWithChildren<NextLinkProps> & {
	href?: LinkProps['href'];
};

function LinkComponent({
	href,
	replace,
	scroll,
	shallow,
	passHref,
	prefetch,
	locale,
	...props
}: LinkComponentProps) {
	if (!href) return <a {...props} />;

	// Use an `a` tag when linking externally
	// Regex finds links starting with: `http://` | `https://` | `//`
	const hrefAsString = typeof href === 'string' ? href : href?.pathname;
	if (hrefAsString && /^(https?:\/\/|\/\/)/i.test(hrefAsString)) {
		return <a href={hrefAsString} {...props} />;
	}

	return (
		<Link
			href={href}
			replace={replace}
			scroll={scroll}
			shallow={shallow}
			passHref={passHref}
			prefetch={prefetch}
			locale={locale}
		>
			<a {...props} />
		</Link>
	);
}
```

## That's it

You can now start using our components!

> We recommend using TypeScript to get the most out of these components. Our [example site](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/tree/main/example-site) already uses TypeScript so you can use that as reference.

## What's next?

Take a look at our wide range of [components](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages), and install the ones you need in your application.
