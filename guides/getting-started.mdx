title: Getting started

Welcome to AgDS - the Design System for the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment.

In this guide, we're going to go through the steps necessary to get started with the React component library from our Design System.

## What is React?

React is a popular framework for building User Interfaces, which our component library is built on.

If you’re new to React we recommend going through official [React getting started documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html), and follow along using the [React Hello World CodePen example](http://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/ZpvBNJ?editors=0010).

## If you’re starting a new project…

We have built an [example site](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/tree/main/example-site) in [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) which you can clone and use as a starting point.

## If you’re implementing components in an existing project…

All of our AgDS components can be used in your existing React application.

In order to get everything working, install the latest versions of these packages…

`yarn add @ag.ds-next/ag-branding @ag.ds-next/box @ag.ds-next/core @ag.ds-next/text @emotion/react facepaint
`

Then wrap your application in our `Core` component…

```jsx
// This example assumes you are using NextJS.
import Link, { LinkProps } from 'next/link';
import { Core } from '@ag.ds-next/core';
import { theme } from '@ag.ds-next/ag-branding';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
	return (
		<Core theme={theme} linkComponent={Link}>
			<Component {...pageProps} />
		</Core>
	);
}

export default MyApp;
```

The `Core` component is responsible for enabling our CSS variables, and also make your chosen framework's Link component available to all of the AgDS components.

You can now start using our components!

> We recommend using TypeScript to get the most out of these components. Our [Example Site](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next/tree/main/example-site) already uses TypeScript so you can use that as reference.

## What's next?

Take a look at our wide range of [components](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages), and install the ones you need in your application.

If you get stuck, feel free to reach out to us in the Design System Teams Chat.
