title: Forms
---

Web forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a web site or application. Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage.

In this guide, we will be building a simple sign in form which could be used to authenticate a user to a web site or application.

### Install AgDS packages

Install the following packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
yarn add @ag.ds-next/field @ag.ds-next/icon @ag.ds-next/text-input @ag.ds-next/button @ag.ds-next/form-stack
```

### Compose the user interface

Using the `TextInput`, `FormStack` and `Button` components, we can quickly compose the user interface for the form.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@ag.ds-next/button';
import { FormStack } from '@ag.ds-next/form-stack';
import { TextInput } from '@ag.ds-next/text-input';

function FormExampleSignIn() {
	return (
		<form>
			<FormStack>
				<TextInput label="Email" required />
				<TextInput label="Password" type="password" required />
				<div>
					<Button type="submit">Sign in</Button>
				</div>
			</FormStack>
		</form>
	);
}
```

### Handling form state

The AgDS component library does not have any opinions for handling form state, instead our components have been designed to work with any form library.

In this step, we will be using `react-hook-form` and `yup` to handle form state and client-side validation. Fore more information about these two libraries, please refer to the [official documentation](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started#SchemaValidation).

Firsly, we need to install these dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
yarn add react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers yup
```

Secondly, we will build our form schema with `yup` and use `react-hook-form` to handle our form state.

```tsx
import { useForm, SubmitHandler } from 'react-hook-form';
import { yupResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/yup';
import * as yup from 'yup';
import { Button } from '@ag.ds-next/button';
import { FormStack } from '@ag.ds-next/form-stack';
import { TextInput } from '@ag.ds-next/text-input';

const formSchema = yup
	.object({
		email: yup
			.string()
			.email('Invalid email address')
			.required('Enter your email address'),
		password: yup.string().required('Enter your password'),
	})
	.required();

type FormSchema = yup.InferType<typeof formSchema>;

export function FormExampleSignIn() {
	const {
		register,
		handleSubmit,
		formState: { errors },
	} = useForm<FormSchema>({
		resolver: yupResolver(formSchema),
	});

	const onSubmit: SubmitHandler<FormSchema> = (data) => {
		console.log(data);
	};

	return (
		<form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
			<FormStack>
				<TextInput
					label="Email address"
					type="email"
					{...register('email')}
					invalid={Boolean(errors.email?.message)}
					message={errors.email?.message}
					maxWidth="xl"
					required
				/>
				<TextInput
					label="Password"
					type="password"
					{...register('password')}
					invalid={Boolean(errors.password?.message)}
					message={errors.password?.message}
					maxWidth="xl"
					required
				/>
				<div>
					<Button type="submit">Sign in</Button>
				</div>
			</FormStack>
		</form>
	);
}
```

## What's next?

Take a look at our wide range of [form components](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/packages/forms), and install the ones you need in your application.

> We recommend using TypeScript to get the most out of these components.
