description: Explaining technical decisions in the AgDS Component library
---

## React

The AgDS Component library is built using React. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

React uses a component-based model for defining UI elements, which is fantastic for building Design Systems and scalable UI generally.

## NPM Packages

The delivery method for the AgDS Component library is via NPM packages. NPM is the package manager for JavaScript and the worldâ€™s largest software registry.

Each component is an individual package. This allows consumers to only install the components they need, and avoid installing unnecessary dependencies and huge bundles for users.

```zsh
yarn add @agds-next/button
```

The trade off is that dependency versions need to be managed carefully. Our [release notes](https://steelthreads.github.io/agds-next/releases) include a list of the latest versions of packages, and any breaking changes that need to be managed with a release.

## TypeScript

All of the AgDS components are built using Typescript, a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Typing component props is a great way of documenting them, and ensure they are easy to use and free of bugs.

You don't need to use Typescript to use AgDS components, but it is recommended.

## Emotion

Emotion is a framework that enables writing styling (CSS) within JavaScript components. As opposed to writing CSS stylesheets, the style code is written alongside the component code, making it easier to maintain and reason.

## Next.JS

Next.JS is a popular framework for building React-based web applications. Describes as 'the SDK for the web', it handles the tooling and configuration needed for a React app, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application. It also has fantastic documentation and developer experience.

We use Next.JS to build our documentation site, templates, and internal test applications.

Using Next.JS massively improves our productivity, because it has built-in solutions for routing, static and server rendering, API routes and more. That means we spend less time on configuration and we can focus on building application logic and layouts.

Unless you have strong technical reasons to use something else, we strongly recommend you clone our Next.JS-based [Starter Kit](https://github.com/steelthreads/agds-next-starter-kit) for your next project.
