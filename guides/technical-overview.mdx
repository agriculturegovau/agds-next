## Next.JS

Next.JS is a popular framework for building React-based web applications. Describes as 'the SDK for the web', it handles the tooling and configuration needed for a React app, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application. It also has fantastic documentation and developer experience.

We use Next.JS to build our documentation site, templates, and internal test applications.

Using Next.JS massively improves our productivity, because it has built-in solutions for routing, static and server rendering, API routes and more. That means we spend less time on configuration and we can focus on building application logic and layouts.

Unless you have strong technical reasons to use something else, we strongly recommend you clone our Next.JS-based [Starter Kit]() for your next project.
