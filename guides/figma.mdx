Our Design System Figma library contains all of the component, colours, icons, and font-styles needed to build applications for the Export Service. The best way to consume this library is to install it into your project file.

The Figma file that drives this library can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/files/project/37217032/AgDS-Agriculture-Design-System?fuid=1049534194839136217).

To install the library or access the master file, you must have access to the [DAFF Figma organisation](https://www.figma.com/files/team/987658210083094931). Contact the capability team for assistance.
