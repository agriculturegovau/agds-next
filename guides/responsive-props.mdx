title: Responsive props
---

The Agriculture Design System provides first class support for mobile-first responsive styles.

Instead of manually writing CSS media queries throughout your codebase, our primitive components allow you to provide array and object value props to add responsive styles to your application.

This responsive syntax is available for all primitive components style props `Box`, `Flex` and `Stack`

## Breakpoints

It is important to understand that our responsive style APIs are dependant on the global `breakpoints` token. Each key in the object refers to the breakpoint name, and each value refers to the the minimum width of the breakpoint.

```tsx
const breakpoint = {
	xs: 0,
	sm: 576,
	md: 768,
	lg: 992,
	xl: 1200,
};
```

> We use the `@media (min-width)` syntax to ensure styles are generated for mobile-first.

## The array syntax

All style props accept arrays as values for mobile-first responsive styles.

To interpret array responsive values, we convert the values defined in our `breakpoints` token and sort them in ascending order. Afterward, we map each values in the array to the corresponding breakpoint.

As a simple example, we will create a `Box` with some padding.

```tsx live
<Box background="shade" padding={2}>
	Hello world
</Box>
```

Now let's update the `padding` prop to make it responsive.

```tsx live
<Box background="shade" padding={[1, 2, 4]}>
	Hello world
</Box>
```

Under the hood, this simple example has generated the following CSS:

```css
.css-1ped26i {
	padding: 1rem;
}

@media (min-width: 576px) {
	.css-1ped26i {
		padding: 2rem;
	}
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
	.css-1ped26i {
		padding: 4rem;
	}
}
```

> To skip certain breakpoints, you can pass `null` to any item in the array to avoid generating unnecessary CSS.

## The object syntax

You can also define responsive styles as an object, with each key in the object mapping to a breakpoint name.

```tsx live
<Box background="shade" height={{ xs: 0, xl: 2 }}>
	Hello world
</Box>
```
