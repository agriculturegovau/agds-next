title: Responsive props
description: The Agriculture Design System provides first class support for mobile-first responsive styles. Instead of manually writing CSS media queries throughout your codebase, our primitive components allow you to provide arrays and objects to generate responsive styles in your project.

## Breakpoints

It is important to understand that our responsive style APIs are dependant on the global `breakpoints` token. Each key in the object refers to the breakpoint name, and each value refers to the the minimum width of the breakpoint.

```tsx
const breakpoint = {
	xs: 0,
	sm: 576,
	md: 768,
	lg: 992,
	xl: 1200,
};
```

> We use the `@media (min-width)` syntax to ensure styles are generated for mobile-first.

## The array syntax

As a simple example, we will create a `Box` with some padding.

```tsx live
<Box background="shade" padding={2}>
	Hello world
</Box>
```

Now let's update the `padding` prop to make it responsive.

```tsx live
<Box background="shade" padding={[1, 2, 4]}>
	Hello world
</Box>
```

Under the hood, this simple example has generated the following CSS:

```css
.css-1ped26i {
	padding: 1rem;
}

@media (min-width: 576px) {
	.css-1ped26i {
		padding: 2rem;
	}
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
	.css-1ped26i {
		padding: 4rem;
	}
}
```

To interpret array responsive values, we convert the values defined in our `breakpoints` token and sort them in ascending order. Afterward, we map each value in the array to a `min-width` media query.

To skip certain breakpoints, you can pass `null` to any item in the array to avoid generating unnecessary CSS.

## The object syntax

You can also define responsive styles as an object, with each key in the object mapping to a breakpoint name.

```tsx live
<Box background="shade" padding={{ xs: 1, xl: 2 }}>
	Hello world
</Box>
```
