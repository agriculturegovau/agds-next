# Release Process

> ⚠️ Draft process. Things may change!

These instructions capture the internal process for making releases of the `@ag.ds-next` packages.

## npm release

Merge the PR named `Version Packages` into `main` on GitHub once tests are passing.

In the command line, run `git pull` to fetch latest changes from `main`.

Run `yarn fresh` to rebuild `node_modules` and clean-up any build output.

Finally, run `yarn publish-changed` to find packages where the version listed in the `package.json` is ahead of the version published on npm, and publish just those packages.

The above command requires publish privileges on npm and a one time password (OTP).

Create git tag relevant to release date, such as `git tag "$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')"`.

Then publish all new tags (releases plus release date version) to GitHub with `git push --tags`.

Copy the successful output of the published packages from the above npm release, example output:

```sh
@ag.ds-next/core@1.0.0
@ag.ds-next/box@1.0.0
@ag.ds-next/text@1.0.0
```

Translate to a `package.json` style syntax for ease of copying, example:

```json
"@ag.ds-next/core": "1.0.0",
"@ag.ds-next/box": "1.0.0",
"@ag.ds-next/text": "1.0.0",
```

Use this output in the next step.

## Github release notes

Create a draft release on GitHub based on the above tag (such as 2022-01-05).

Give the release a title using the date of the release like `✨ January 5th, 2022`.

Use emoji to indicate the type of release:

```
⚙️ : Indicates a patch release. Bug fixes only.
✨ : Indicates a release with new features. Minor or major version changes.
```

Use the template below and update the following details:

- Summary headline of what's in the release
- Release description of what is new. This may be taken from the changelogs but should remove the noise. In some cases it may be better to write something new.
- The Docs website link
- Packages output (formatted for easy copy paste into package.json)
- Verbose release notes link (link to the PR)

> ⚠️ Note: All releases under the `@ag.ds-next` package scope should be considered alpha pre-releases. Expect breaking changes. Once we are happy with the state of the core packages we will migrate all packages to `@ag.ds`.
